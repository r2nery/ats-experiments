          <content>&amp;quot;It&amp;apost;s not rocket science to control these outbreaks but instead basic epidemiology: infection control, hygiene practices, contact-tracing and safe burial practices,&amp;quot; says Heymann of the virus, which is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids.</content>

        <sentence id="15">
          <content>The usual response in disease outbreaks is to use drugs to treat those infected and stop them transmitting to others, in combination with vaccines that protect those exposed and slow down, or halt, the spread of a virus through a population by enabling herd immunity.</content>
        </sentence>
        <sentence id="16">
          <content>But there are no licensed drugs or vaccines for use against Ebola as its periodic, remote and usually small-scale nature means there has not been a big enough market, nor the ability to conduct large-scale trials in humans exposed to the disease.</content>

      <sentences>
        <sentence id="17">
          <content>The biology of the virus also makes it challenging to develop vaccines that create a strong enough immune response; the occurrence of multiple forms of the virus means an immune response is needed against all of them, and Ebola&amp;apost;s ability to replicate rapidly means it could equally rapidly evolve resistance to the vaccine.</content>

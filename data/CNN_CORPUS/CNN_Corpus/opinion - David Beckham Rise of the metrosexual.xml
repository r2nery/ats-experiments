          <content>It is sometimes easy to forget that David Beckham was ever a midfielder of the highest caliber with more than 100 appearances for England.</content>

          <content>He wore a sarong, a headscarf, nail varnish, adorned his body with tattoos and changed his expertly coiffured hair-do practically every week.</content>
        </sentence>
        <sentence id="4">
          <content>He spoke sparingly and, when he did, it was with a high-pitched, slightly effeminate whine.</content>

          <content>And, as far as anyone could tell, his female partner seemed to make all the important decisions.</content>

          <content>In the 1990s, we called Beckham a New Man, or a metrosexual.</content>
        </sentence>
        <sentence id="8">
          <content>He was evidently straight, but never aggressive or even assertive in a traditional masculine way.</content>
        </sentence>
        <sentence id="9">
          <content>In fact, he seemed mild-mannered.</content>

        <sentence id="11">
          <content>There was a shimmering complexity, a quiet elegance, and perhaps even a sly wit about Beckham.</content>
        </sentence>
        <sentence id="12">
          <content>Footballers, as the world knew them, were hard-boiled characters, who liked a drink and a good play up, especially after a game.</content>
        </sentence>
        <sentence id="13">
          <content>Their reputation was hewn from the granite of working class tradition -- men were tough and affectless.</content>
        </sentence>
        <sentence id="14">
          <content>We can barely imagine the reaction in the locker room when Beckham unpacked moisturizer, bronzer, and assorted hair products from his kit bag.</content>

        <sentence id="15">
          <content>In the late 1990s, when he first surfaced, only Beckham could get away with it.</content>
        </sentence>
        <sentence id="16">
          <content>After all, he enjoyed the adoration of women all over the world, had a pop star girlfriend and soon-to-be wife, and had to fend off advertisers who clamored for his endorsement services.</content>
        </sentence>
        <sentence id="17">
          <content>He was a man with the world at his feet.</content>
        </sentence>
        <sentence id="18">

    <paragraph id="6">
      <sentences>
        <sentence id="19">
          <content>Today, cultural history is unimaginable without Beckham -- because he helped change that history.</content>
        </sentence>
        <sentence id="20">
          <content>He slew the image of the unrelentingly macho sport hero and emerged heroically as the world&amp;apost;s first all-purpose celebrity athlete.</content>

        <sentence id="21">
          <content>A symbol of a new masculinity.</content>

    <paragraph id="7">
      <sentences>
        <sentence id="22">
          <content>And still we have to remind ourselves: Beckham was never rated as the best footballer in the world.</content>
        </sentence>
        <sentence id="23">
          <content>And, far from being a hellraiser or a serial womanizer like many a notorious sports figure, he was squeaky clean.</content>
        </sentence>
      </sentences>
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph id="8">
      <sentences>
        <sentence id="24">
          <content>Well, at least until 2004 when the News of the World tabloid alleged that he had an affair -- something he denied.</content>
        </sentence>
        <sentence id="25">
          <content>Paradoxically, the alleged affair added rather than subtracted from his already iconic status, introducing a dash of devilry and rescuing Beckham from a kind of borderline piousness, and perhaps issuing a reminder that, despite all the affectations, his manhood was beyond doubt.</content>

    </paragraph>
    <paragraph id="10">
      <sentences>
        <sentence id="27">
          <content>There were two David Beckhams: one the flesh-and-blood mortal who kicked a ball around for a living, the other a character that existed independently of time and space -- a product of our imaginations.</content>
        </sentence>
      </sentences>
    </paragraph>
    <paragraph id="11">
      <sentences>
        <sentence id="28">
          <content>Everyone thought they knew Beckham and enjoyed a secret relationship with him.</content>
        </sentence>
        <sentence id="29">
          <content>He was like a blank canvas.</content>
        </sentence>
        <sentence id="30">
          <content>Had he espoused his own views, or aligned himself with great causes he would have spoiled it.</content>
        </sentence>
        <sentence id="31">
          <content>But he was silent, giving interviews rarely -- and, I suspect, at Victoria&amp;apost;s discretion.</content>
        </sentence>
        <sentence id="32">
          <content>And while he stayed largely unknown, the Beckham mystique grew.</content>

    <paragraph id="12">
      <sentences>
        <sentence id="33">
          <content>When Beckham first entered the popular consciousness it was amid feelings of hate and revenge.</content>
        </sentence>
        <sentence id="34">
          <content>Red-carded in a crucial England game against Argentina in the 1998 World Cup, Beckham was blamed for his team&amp;apost;s exit.</content>
        </sentence>
        <sentence id="35">
          <content>Effigies of him were burnt and he was forced to retreat.</content>
        </sentence>
        <sentence id="36">
          <content>It&amp;apost;s difficult to imagine the intensity of the loathing back then.</content>
        </sentence>
        <sentence id="37">
          <content>Yet it was crucial in generating interest, even, passion.</content>

    <paragraph id="13">
      <sentences>
        <sentence id="38">
          <content>The sight, even the name of Beckham stirred up powerful feelings.</content>

        <sentence id="39">
          <content>Football fans may have despised him, but others were just curious.</content>
        </sentence>
        <sentence id="40">
          <content>And they became more curious as Beckham defiantly refused to give interviews or make public appearances, save for at the occasional fashion launch or a party hosted by a rock star or designer.</content>
        </sentence>
        <sentence id="41">
          <content>All this was very un-footballer-like and faintly unmanly.</content>

          <content>By the time Beckham and Victoria were married in 1999, interest in him had extended far beyond the football fraternity.</content>
        </sentence>
        <sentence id="43">
          <content>His most devoted followers knew nothing of football.</content>
        </sentence>

          <content>Unlike traditional sport fans, they were not interested in how he played: they were interested in him -- just Beckham.</content>

        <sentence id="45">
          <content>At the start of the 21st century, there was only an embryonic celebrity culture; the fascination we now have for people who make no material impact on our lives and, in many cases, had no accomplishments of note was a new and perplexing development.</content>
        </sentence>

          <content>Fans knew famous sportsmen and women by their talents and achievements.</content>

          <content>Two adult lions and two cubs have been killed so that a new male can be introduced into the captive group to &amp;quot;make room for a new generation.&amp;quot;</content>

        <sentence id="3">
          <content>In remarks reminiscent of those made to justify the death of Marius, the zoo&amp;apost;s director Steffen Straede claimed the lions had to be put down &amp;quot;partly to avoid inbreeding between the two young lions and their father.&amp;quot;</content>

          <content>So I went to Vienna for a few days and wandered around, and very early one morning I found myself at the Freud museum, which is his old apartment house, and I had this strange kind of Proustian shiver as I stood outside the front door waiting to be admitted, because it&amp;apost;s been kept exactly as it was pretty much.</content>

        <sentence id="32">
          <content>That&amp;apost;s a very simplified version of it and you would need to be guided by a therapist but fundamentally parallelism is creating a parallel life for yourself where the bad things didn&amp;apost;t happen and only good things took place.</content>

          <content>With that profile, some viewers automatically see her as non-credible and uneducated, and every frustrated or irritable word coming out of her mouth reinforced the stereotypes of black teens that all too many Americans (of all colors) believe in.</content>

          <content>A single friend of mine in her 30s watching the trial in Washington, D.C., said to me: &amp;quot;Imagine if you had to get on the witness stand and talk about how the boy you had a crush on was shot and killed right after you got off the phone with him.</content>

          <content>Ultimately, after a cross-examination that was sometimes tense, sometimes hostile, and definitely riveting, we are left to determine whether Jeantel swayed the case for the prosecution or for the defense.</content>

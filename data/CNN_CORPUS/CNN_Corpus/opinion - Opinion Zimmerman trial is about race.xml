          <content>&amp;quot;You have to look at the nature of the case and the racial, political and social economics of the defendant and accused.</content>

          <content>You have a young black kid, walking with a sweatshirt on and some guy, who wants to be a cop, assumes he&amp;apost;s a criminal and shoots him dead.&amp;quot;</content>

        <sentence id="25">
          <content>So he -- and not Martin, the victim -- has gotten the benefit of presumption of innocence.</content>

      <sentences>
        <sentence id="28">
          <content>It seems Zimmerman, in part because he belonged to his neighborhood watch group, has been granted the status of a police officer.</content>

      <sentences>
        <sentence id="31">
          <content>Normally, the prosecutor in a high-profile murder case puts forth evidence to prove the defendant&amp;apost;s guilt and aggressively goes after any notion that suggests that the victim is at fault.</content>
        </sentence>
        <sentence id="32">
          <content>The prosecution&amp;apost;s goal is to do anything it can to convince a jury that the killer is a menace that needs to be taken off the street.</content>

        <sentence id="33">
          <content>That&amp;apost;s how the battle is won in the courtroom.</content>

        <sentence id="35">
          <content>Could it be that Mantei himself buys into the theory that Zimmerman is some misunderstood do-gooder in the community?</content>

          <content>It&amp;apost;s just puzzling.</content>

          <content>It has been all too easy an idea for people to entertain that Martin did something to cause his own murder.</content>

          <content>History tells us that in our nation&amp;apost;s courtrooms and even outside of those walls, my son, your son, our sons still don&amp;apost;t have the presumption of innocence, even when they are the victims of a murder.</content>

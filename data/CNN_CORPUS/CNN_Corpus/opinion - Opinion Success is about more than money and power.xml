          <content>Humans lead complex lives, and one of the traits we&amp;apost;ve developed that has allowed us to be such productive creatures is the ability to make many learned traits and responses an automatic part of our lives, buried so deeply in the inner workings of our subconscious that they no longer require conscious thought.</content>

          <content>We might think we&amp;apost;re in charge of our thoughts and behavior -- captains of our ship, turning the wheel this way and that -- but so often it&amp;apost;s actually our autopilot that&amp;apost;s in control.</content>

          <content>In the same way, if we&amp;apost;re not able to reprogram our autopilot, all our protestations of wanting to change will be as pointless as the little boy furiously turning the wheel on the cruise ship.</content>

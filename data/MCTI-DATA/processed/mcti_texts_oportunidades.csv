"Objective The DAAD programme ""German Colonial Rule"", funded by the Federal Foreign Office of Germany, invites young researchers to apply for DAAD scholarships for PhD thesis projects. The aim of the scholarship programme is to promote research on German government institutions and policies and their political, economic and cultural impact on and in the former German colonies. The scholarship will enable recipients to obtain a doctorate in Germany. They will have one supervisor from a university in Germany and one from a co-operating university in Africa or the Asia-Pacific region, and they will be able to carry out research in archives and at universities in Germany, Africa and Asia-Pacific. Scholars from Africa and the Asia-Pacific region are particularly encouraged to apply. By funding projects in this field, the programme aims to create a shared space for research on the history of German colonialism and racism, thus laying the foundation for long-term research partnerships. Research projects should focus on the German colonial period as well as its aftermath and address the Colonial Department of Germany's Foreign Office, the Reichskolonialamt (Imperial Colonial Office) and/or other organisations and individuals involved in Germany's colonial rule. Emphasis may be laid on political, economic and/or cultural dimensions of colonial rule. Researchers may also concentrate on the cooperation between the German administration, intermediaries and political elites in the colonies as well as on specific administrative acts. Comparative studies focusing on colonial rule in colonies of different European empires are equally welcome. Possible areas of focus include (by way of example): (collective) biographies of individuals who were in the service of Germany's Foreign Office, the Imperial Colonial Office, colonial governments, district offices, etc. studies of cultural brokers and intermediariesstudies of administrative practices, e. g. in the fields of law, health, labour policy, trade or the military (including the looting of objects and human remains)comparative research on different colonial regimesstudies of the history of colonial theories, colonialism and racismstudies of regions that were affected by German colonial rule Successful candidates' PhD studies will be overseen by two supervisors, one from Germany and one from a cooperating university in Africa or the Asia-Pacific region (see appendix). Applicants may indicate their preferred supervisors in their application. However, successful candidates may be re-assigned to other supervisors during evaluation of the applications.

In the course of the programme, the scholarship holders will be expected to: submit an annual reportcomplete and successfully defend a PhD thesis after four yearsattend an annual meeting with the other programme participantsThese workshops will also involve the PhD supervisors and will additionally be open to interested researchers who are not participating in the scholarship programme, creating a space for networking as well as academic discussion. Furthermore, the scholarship holders will be invited to present the results of their research at the Federal Foreign Office. Who can apply? Applications are open to excellently qualified researchers aspiring to complete a doctorate on the history of German colonial rule and the role of German authorities and organisations. Scholars from Africa and the Asia-Pacific region are particularly encouraged to apply. Applicants must have an above-average university degree that entitles them to enrol in a doctoral programme. Applicants should also have some basic knowledge of German, and should have graduated no longer than 6 years ago. What can be funded? The scholarship will permit PhD studies at an eligible German university (see appendix), with integrated periods of research at a co-operating university in Africa or the Asia-Pacific region. These studies will be supervised by an academic adviser at the host institution in Germany and an academic adviser at the co-operating university. In line with the cooperative approach of the programme, the supervisors will jointly support scholarship holders in the course of their research project, creating a shared space for joint research. Under this flexible, multi-phase funding system, successful candidates will begin their studies in Germany and subsequently spend research periods at the cooperating university. They will complete their doctoral degree at their German host university in close cooperation with their academic supervisor from the co-operating university. The abovementioned structure may vary depending on the individual research project. Candidates who wish to follow an alternative research path should explain their research plan and schedule thoroughly in their proposal.

Selection procedure The review procedure takes place in 2 phases: In the first step, the preselection, the Studienstiftung checks whether the formal framework conditions and the requirements of the Studienstiftung are met. These include: a committed and well above average successfully completed degreethe support of the supervisora broad horizon of interests as well as indications that the applicant has committed himself / herself in his / her careerAt this stage, the synopsis of the doctoral project is not included in the assessment. If an application is successful in the pre-selection process, in the next step we obtain 2 written, external reports - one specialist report and one interview report. Basically, both reports should comment on the technical and non-technical qualifications of the applicant as well as on the quality and the general conditions of the proposed doctoral project. Interviews We ask experts who are closely involved in the subject of the dissertation to provide expert opinions. They formulate their assessments on the basis of the written documents and, in particular, take into account the professional qualifications of the applicant and the submitted synopsis in their reports. The second expert opinion, the interview expert opinion, is entrusted to people who are not necessarily equally subject-specific. In addition to the written documents, they base their impressions on a personal interview. The interview report therefore not only expresses the technical dimension, but also goes into more detail on the personality and career of the applicant. We try to avoid long journeys when selecting the interview experts; we cannot cover travel expenses. If candidates are abroad at the time of their application, we will be happy to check whether experts are available on site for discussions. As a rule, we assume the applicants' willingness to attend appointments for selection interviews in Germany. Due to the pandemic, the selection interviews are currently usually taking place via video calls. As soon as both reviews are available, the funding application will be discussed and decided on at the next meeting of the selection committee for doctoral candidates. This meets 4 times a year. The selection process takes about 4 to 6 months on average, but can also take longer or shorter in individual cases.

The Volkswagen Foundation and, if applicable, one of the Stifterverband's affiliated foundations each enter into a commitment for a starting capital of 1 million EUR per professorship. Another 3 million EUR must be guaranteed by the host university through fundraising. Eligible for funding are highly qualified researchers of all disciplines and nationalities who, together with the target university in Germany, are in international comparison among the leaders in their respective fields of research. Target Group highly qualified scientists of all disciplines and nationalities who are (among) the leaders in their respective fields in an international comparison W2 or W3 professorships are primarily supported, preferably returning scientists or applicants from abroad.

"In March 2018, the Senate of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) established the Priority Programme ""Radiomics: Next Generation of Biomedical Imaging"" (SPP 2177). The programme is designed to run for six years. The present call now invites proposals for the second three-year funding period. Biomedical imaging has substantially developed over the last decades and plays an increasingly central role in the management of various disease settings in modern medicine. In addition, imaging is progressively more incorporated in research settings, including the formation of large-scale, population-based cohorts, such as the German National Cohort (NAKO Gesundheitsstudie). In parallel, with the advent of powerful, large scale computational power facilities and growing on-site expertise, advanced post-processing methods, including Artificial Intelligence, Deep-Learning, or Radiomics, are used to abstract descriptive, diagnostic, or prognostic information from high-resolution imaging data. As such, these derived parameters (""imaging phenotypes"") complement traditionally available and used image information, such as manual measurements of diameters or the mere presence of disease states and allow for high-volume, reproducible, and high-quality interpretation skills. However, despite these successful endeavours, there is still only early evidence that such advanced computer-based imaging post-processing provides incremental diagnostic and prognostic information in the field of personalised medicine, and algorithms have not fully entered the clinical arena yet. Given the great promise, the Priority Programme is designed to further develop and establish the role of advanced image interpretation approaches in different clinical scenarios in personalised medicine, including prevention of disease development. The Priority Programme requires complementary, multidisciplinary teams with expertise in different fields, including clinical imaging, computational science, epidemiology and/or health technology assessment. The interaction among interdisciplinary teams will establish a synergistic platform for successful translational research and effective clinical implementation of imaging techniques. As the Priority Programme should have a lasting impact on the national and international scientific landscape, a mandatory prerequisite for participation is an intention to add value by collaborating with the other projects within the programme. Inclusion of female applicants, clinician-scientists, and early-career researchers is strongly encouraged. Proposals submitted to this call should address at least one of the following fundamental aims:to determine the diagnostic clinical value of advanced post-processing methods of human imaging data in different clinically relevant and/or in basic research settings;to determine the prognostic value of advanced post-processing methods of human imaging data in clinically relevant settings and/or in basic research settings. We highly encourage applications of projects within the field of cross-organ and/or cross-system research. Compared to the first funding period of the Priority Programme, particular emphasis will be given to projects that focus on the clinical implementation and value of advanced image analysis as well as the application of these techniques to gain deeper understanding of the role of imaging phenotypes in large-scale population cohorts. Proposals eligible under the present call are proposals that:stem from high-quality prospective studies with a statistically reasonable sample size and clearly defined endpoints;comprise computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging data or their combination with other advanced imaging modalities. Similar to the first call, not eligible are proposals that:purely focus on the development of image analysis algorithms;include image acquisition or outcome data collection. Proposal SubmissionProposals must be submitted in English via the DFG's electronic submission system ""elan"" selecting ""SPP 2177/2 - Radiomics"" by 15 June 2022. Applicants must be registered in elan prior to submitting a proposal to the DFG.

"The Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) and the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) are pleased to announce a call for proposals for German-Korean joint workshops and research visits. Proposals must be submitted not later than 14 April 2022. This initiative aims to bring together relevant and competitive researchers from Germany and South Korea to establish collaborative scientific relationships and prepare joint projects. Funding is available for the following collaborative measures:exploratory workshops;research visits (max. three months). Both components can be combined if they are in close temporal relationship and if this facilitates especially effective preparation of a joint project. All individual collaborative measures must be carried out within a maximum period of twelve months. Early career scientists holding a doctoral degree are strongly encouraged to participate in the above-mentioned activities. Each national funding organisation will fund the costs for travel and accommodation of the researchers based in its own country. Organisational costs for workshops and for participants in workshops from third countries are funded by the funding organisation of the host country. Funding is only available for projects which involve a convincing collaboration between the German and Korean partners and for which the anticipated research benefit is clearly outlined. Proposals must be submitted to both organisations in accordance with the proposal preparation requirements of both sides, respectively. Applicants from Korea submit their documents to the NRF, applicants from Germany to the DFG. Applicants to be funded by the DFG are requested to fulfil the eligibility requirements of DFG Initiation of International Collaboration and use the corresponding application form, see the corresponding guidelines of the Initiation of International Collaboration Programme (DFG form 1. 813). The components ""exploratory workshops"" and ""project-related trips abroad"" can be funded. The component ""project-related guest visits"" cannot be funded since costs for travel and accommodation of researchers based in Korea who are visiting partners in Germany are funded by NRF. For applicants to be funded by the DFG the ""Duty to Cooperate"" within Germany for members of non-university institutions with permanent positions applies. All documents must be written in English and must be submitted by 14 April 2022. Proposals arriving late and/or those not fulfilling the national requirements will not be considered.

"Within the current funding initiative on next generation sequencing (NGS) of the Senate of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation), the DFG invites, in its fifth round, proposals for projects in which sequencing will be carried out at DFG-funded competence centres for next generation sequencing at the universities of Bonn/Cologne/Düsseldorf, Dresden, Kiel, and Tübingen. As in the past, this call provides funding for projects with anticipated sequencing costs of €100,000 to €1 million. In particular, the call aims at projects that require sequencing services to be carried out in the first year (2023) after approval. Eligibility and Proposal RequirementsApplicants must meet the standard eligibility criteria required in the research grants programme. Proposals may be submitted individually or jointly by more than one applicant, for instance, if additional expertise, such as sample preparation and data analysis, is included. Only projects whose sequencing cost requirement is scientifically justified and in the mandatory range as mentioned above (€100,000 to €1 million) may be requested. Projects not reaching the lower threshold are recommended to apply in the regular individual research grants programme. Sequencing costs include all expenses that will be incurred by the relevant competence centre within the framework of the project (such as sample preparation). The proposal process requires that a declaration of intent be submitted in advance (see dates, deadlines and further information). The DFG will notify all planned projects of which centre to contact to receive the necessary counselling report with the anticipated sequencing costs. ProposalsAll proposals within this call are submitted as regular individual research grants. New projects, particularly from the life sciences, are invited to apply. In addition to requesting the standard funding modules for individual grants (e. g. the basic module including funding for staff, direct project costs and instrumentation), the necessary need for sequencing costs must be specified separately. Further, proposals may also be submitted that result from projects that are currently being funded by either the DFG or others and for which the need for increased sequencing requirements has developed during the course of the project. Such proposals must also be scientifically justified, i. e. address a scientific question, and explain the adjustments to the original project plan; however, when applying for funds, they may only include the required sequencing costs. Proposals simply expanding the original project plan, or solely descriptive approaches, will not receive high priority. Important: The call, in particular, aims at projects that require sequencing services to be carried out immediately in the first year (2023) after approval of the proposal. Therefore, please indicate the status of the samples intended for sequencing, whether they have been subjected to a quality check, and when the sequencing work is expected to commence. Further, specify the sequencing tasks and the requested sequencing budget with respect to the individual work packages. In addition, include information on how the necessary bioinformatics will be handled. Where applicable, describe the necessary statistical details with respect to sample numbers. Dates, DeadlinesThe submission of a letter of intent is required in advance of submission of a full proposal. Declarations of intent must be sent as a PDF file to Link auf E-MailWGI-NGS@dfg. de no later than 15 March 2022 using the form ""Declaration of Intent"" (DoI_Sequencing_Costs, see below). Please use the following file name structure when sending in the form: DoI_Sequencing_Costs_LastNameContactPerson_FirstNameContactPerson_City. At this stage, no consultation with one of the sequencing centres is required. For your cost estimate, please use current market prices as an orientation. The project content of the later proposal must be the same as that stated in the letter of intent. The DFG will notify you of which sequencing centre to contact for negotiating your experimental details. Please include the relevant centre's ""Counselling Report"" in your proposal documents. Proposals must be submitted to the DFG by 1 June 2022 at the latest. Please note that proposals can only be submitted via elan, the DFG's electronic proposal processing system. To submit a proposal within this call, go to Proposal Submission - New Project / Draft Proposal - Individual Grants Programme - Proposal for a Research Grant - Start online form (Continue) - Call for Proposals and select ""Sequencing Costs (2022)"" from the current list of calls. The structure of your proposal must correspond to the structure provided in the proposal instructions for project proposals (DFG form 54. 01). Proposals must be written in English. When uploading your details, please provide the sum for sequencing costs (according to the ""Counselling Report"") under the module ""Services"". In addition, include the respective amount in your proposal document (DFG form 53. 01 elan) under section 7. 1. 2. 5 Other Costs. If this is your first proposal to the DFG, note that applicants must be registered in elan prior to submitting a proposal to the DFG. If you have not yet registered, please note that you must do so by 25 May 2022 to submit a proposal under this call; registration requests received after this time cannot be considered. You will normally receive confirmation of your registration by the next working day. You will be asked to select the call mentioned above from the list during both the registration and the proposal process. Applicants will be awarded funding for standard project costs (staff, direct project costs and instrumentation), and receive authorisation for sequencing services, which the centres settle directly with the DFG in accordance with their requirements.

"The DKN (Deutsches Komitee für Nachhaltigkeitsforschung in Future Earth - German Committee Future Earth) is an advisory board mandated by the Executive Committee of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation). The DKN's mandate includes furtherance of the scientific sustainability agenda by identifying and composing strategically significant topics in sustainability research and integrating them into the international Future Earth and World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) platforms. The DKN acts as the national contact point for international developments and activities implemented in the context of these international platforms/research programmes. The DKN also assumes the task of helping shape Future Earth's development process in a substantive and structural manner. The DKN is setting up new working groups to strengthen the sustainability research in Germany and to support scientists in the development of relevant research activities within sustainability science. Working groups receive funding for two meetings of the working group members (nine people, incl. spokesperson) and for organising a DFG round table (max. 30 people) within a period of 1. 5 to maximum of two years. Applications may be sent to info@dkn-future-earth. de by 1 April 2022. By establishing working groups, the DKN promotes the development of research topics that are in the international context of sustainability research. Working groups based at DKNare closely related to one of the topics of the DKN position paper (Jacob, D. et al. , 2022: Research priorities for sustainability science. German Committee Future Earth, Hamburg, Germany), orcontribute to another innovative research field which is described in the proposal concerning its scientific relevance,contribute to a significant impact of German research in the international research landscape and pursue both content-related and research-strategic goals,can develop strategies for inter- and transdisciplinary joint projects. At the end of the working group's term, a concrete product should emerge, which must be named in the proposal and agreed on at the first working group meeting. Examples for working group products are:elaboration of a research agenda with open research questions (addressed to science and research funding), orprospects for a German research project in an international context, orposition paper or policy paper with the main results and conclusions of the working group aimed at defined addressees.

"The Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) supports the Canadian New Frontiers in Research Fund (NFRF) within a new special call. Launched in 2018, the NFRF funds interdisciplinary, high-risk / high-reward, transformative research led by Canadian researchers working with Canadian and international partners. The NFRF is under the strategic direction of the Canada Research Coordinating Committee (CRCC) which advances federal research priorities and the coordination of policies and programmes of Canada's research funding agencies and the Canada Foundation for Innovation. The CRCC will soon launch the NFRF special call: Research for Post-Pandemic Recovery. This programme aims to mobilise research efforts in support of a more equitable, sustainable and resilient post-pandemic reality. It will support a diverse portfolio of projects that directly address one or more of the research priorities outlined in the UN Research Roadmap for COVID-19 Recovery. While the NFRF call requires the principal investigator to be based in Canada, it also requires the involvement of international collaborators and allows for the transfer of funds outside of Canada to support international participation. The UN Research Roadmap was developed in 2020 under the leadership of Canadian research organisations in a global consultative process in which more than 250 experts took part. DFG's Commission for Pandemic Research and the German Committee Future Earth (DKN-Future Earth) support the roadmap and emphasised in a joint statement that the roadmap represents a signal and a clear commitment to a science-driven, evidence-based approach to dealing with the consequences of the pandemic (Information for Researchers No. 107 | 22 December 2020). In order to strengthen international cooperation in the field of Research for Post-Pandemic Recovery the DFG draws attention to the NFRF call. Interested researchers in Germany are in principle eligible for NFRF funds that can be used to support the research activities of international researchers. They have to be part of the research team and are encouraged to reach out to their Canadian research partners to prepare proposals for the competition. Details can be found in the NFRF call text (see link below). Please note that the DFG cannot offer direct co-funding within the call. However, researchers eligible for DFG funding can liaise with the Research for Post-Pandemic Recovery programme through an independent individual research grant proposal to the DFG with reference to a related cooperation. The framework of the Individual Research Grants Programme offers e. g. funding for travel expenses, funding for visiting researchers from abroad as well as funding for fellows to enable intensive and long-term exchange with visiting researchers (see DFG forms 52. 01 and 52. 05). The submission of proposals is possible at any time. Proposals should be written in English and must be submitted via the DFG elan system according to the guidelines for the programme ""Research Grants Programme"" (DFG form 50. 01). It is important for DFG applicants to note that there are no special funds available for these efforts. The review process is carried out separately from the NFRF call according to the DFG's criteria for the Review of Research Grants (see DFG form 10. 206) and proposals must succeed on the strengths of their intellectual merit and compete with all other proposals in the Research Grants Programme.

"In an effort to further strengthen the scientific cooperation between India and Germany, the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India (DST), and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) have agreed to extend their funding opportunities for joint research projects between both countries to the International Research Training Group (IRTG) programme and hereby invite applications under a joint application and funding scheme. Background and Description of International Research Training GroupsInternational Research Training Groups (IRTG), in which German universities cooperate with research institutions in other countries, combine innovative top-level research and the structured promotion of excellent early career researchers. As bilateral collaborations set up by experienced scientists, IRTG promote systematic scientific cooperation through joint research programmes and corresponding qualification measures for doctoral and postdoctoral researchers. A central feature of IRTG are coordinated and reciprocal research visits by doctoral researchers at the respective partner institutions. IRTG can only be established by universities and research institutions entitled to confer doctoral degrees. Structure of Indo-German Research Training GroupsApplications for Indo-German IRTG intended for DFG-DST funding are open to all subject areas covered by DST and interdisciplinarity in joint projects is encouraged. An IRTG should be run by two teams of participating researchers in India and Germany, respectively. Each team should have approximately five to ten members with proven expertise both in the IRTG's main research topic and in providing outstanding supervision to doctoral students. The participating researchers' expertise at the two locations should be complementary and provide added value to the IRTG. Each team of participating researchers in an IRTG should be based at a single institution in India and Germany, respectively. In convincingly justified cases, an IRTG may be based in more than two institutions. The Indian and German teams in an IRTG should jointly formulate a high quality and coherent research and training programme to be implemented on both sides. The teams should have common research interests and objectives and these must be reflected in a common framework and joint project. Applications are submitted by the host institutions. For every IRTG, one member of the team on each side serves as spokesperson, being responsible for the proposal and the scientific coordination of the IRTG. This also includes responsibility for reporting to DST and DFG, respectively. The programme should provide for regular exchanges of academic staff and doctoral students for the purposes of joint research and training. Doctoral students should spend a period of at least six months (and up to one year) in total during their PhD project at the respective partner institution for research and training and each doctoral student should have both an Indian and a German supervisor. On the German side, approximately ten to fifteen doctoral researchers will be funded within a single IRTG in parallel. The partner site in India should support a group of doctoral researchers of roughly the same size. Funding Guidelines for Indo-German Research Training GroupsBoth DST and DFG will provide funding for IRTG project-specific costs incurred by their respective partner institutions. In accordance with respective internal policies of DST and DFG, funds can be requested for the following activities:funding for PhD positions/fellowships up to 48 months per doctoral researcher,project-specific funding for dissertation research projects (e. g. consumables),longer-term, coordinated and reciprocal research visits (one or more with an overall duration of six to twelve months) by doctoral students to the respective partner institutions,joint workshops, conferences and seminars,short-term visits, lectures and workshops by the participating researchers. As an additional support mechanism, both DST and DFG will make funds available to support preparatory workshops for IRTG applications. Duration of Funding for Indo-German Research Training GroupsIndo-German IRTG will be supported for a potential maximum of nine years, divided into two funding periods, with a mid-term evaluation on whose outcome the grant of the second period depends. Both parties will accept only joint proposals by Indian and German institutions. All joint applications are to be prepared according to the respective DST/DFG guidelines for IRTG and have to provide separate budget requests for the Indian and the German part of the project. Application and Evaluation of ProposalsThe Indo-German consortium will firstly need to submit a joint IRTG draft proposal simultaneously to DFG and DST. (For DFG, the proposal needs to be submitted by the German university. ) The first deadline for draft proposal submission is 1 August 2022. Thereafter, there will be two deadlines each year: 1 February and 1 August. DFG and DST will evaluate the draft proposal independently. On average, around six to eight months are needed for the review. If both agencies conclude their review with a positive decision, DST and DFG then invite the consortium to submit a joint full proposal according to a mutually agreed time line. Again, the joint full proposal must be sent to DST and DFG simultaneously. Submission must be in accordance with the respective funding organisation's guidelines and through the established submission systems. Renewal proposals for the second funding period are submitted twelve months before the end of the first funding period. They are submitted by the German host university to DFG and by the Indian spokesperson / host institution to DST in parallel. Submission must be in accordance with the respective funding organisation's guidelines and through the established submission systems. Full proposals and renewal proposals will also be evaluated separately by DST and DFG. The reviews of all proposals will be based on the DFG criteria for IRTG. Preparatory WorkshopsFor new Indo-German IRTG initiatives, DST and DFG provide for the possibility to support a workshop for the preparation of an IRTG proposal. Funding can be granted only if research cooperation is already established and plans for the IRTG have already been consolidated. The workshop funding may either be applied for prior to the draft proposal submission, or - after positive evaluation of the draft proposal - prior to submission of the full proposal. Funding of preparatory workshops by DST depends on a positive evaluation of the draft proposal. Information EventIn order to further promote the new Indo-German IRTG programme and to answer open questions, DST and DFG will hold a virtual information event in the first half of 2022. The precise date and registration details will be communicated separately closer to the event.

"The Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) announces the first ""Workshop for Early Career Investigators in Engineered Living Materials (ELM)"". Early career scientists interested in this emerging and rapidly growing field will be interdisciplinary trained and prepared for the submission of their own project proposal at the DFG. The participants will have the opportunity to further develop their own innovative ideas and apply for one-year funding to kick-off their career in ELM. BackgroundNature is a major source of inspiration for materials engineering. Lightweight construction, photonic structures or intelligent actuation are just a few examples reflecting a variety of design principles and functions evolved in natural materials that have led to materials and technological development. In spite of notable achievements, reconstructing natural designs with synthetic materials remains cumbrous. In the last few years, the idea of ELM has emerged as a paradigm change in bioinspired materials engineering. ELM aim to integrate living organisms as active components of man-made materials, with the purpose of augmenting non-living matter with life-like capabilities. In ELM, tools from biotechnology and synthetic biology are combined with materials chemistry and engineering, and provide new capabilities for bottom-up generation of (multi)materials in situ, and for programming multifunctionality by integrating sensing and actuating capabilities in single components. Objectives and contentThe workshop for early career researchers aims at initiating an ELM community in Germany, by accelerating interdisciplinary training and exchange among researchers in materials and life sciences. The early career scientists will acquire complementary skills in ELM-specific research principles and techniques, they will enjoy seminar talks from invited international experts, and they will receive feedback from experts to their own research ideas as well as career plans in the highly innovative ELM field. With these skills, feedback, experience, and networking the participants will be optimally prepared to develop and implement innovative research in ELM. The workshop will be organised as follows: After a ""Virtual Information and Networking Event"" (18. 02. 2022), participants are invited to apply for the workshop by submitting a concise outline of their research idea in ELM and their CV (deadline 03. 04. 2022). Up to 20 participants will be invited to a one-week in-person workshop (17. -23. 06. 2022). Two weeks after the in-person workshop, we will offer the virtual workshop ""Your Project and Profile"" (two half days). The in-person workshop comprises:The Methods Toolbox: We will organise two specific courses combining theoretical and practical elements: ""Materials Design and Characterisation"" (for participants with a primary background in life sciences) as well as ""Programming Cell Fate and Function"" (for participants with a primary background in materials sciences). In addition, a practice-oriented training module of how to develop and structure a successful research proposal adapted to the specific career phase will be offered. Meet the Experts: The workshop will include access to the ""Third International Conference on Engineered Living Materials"" that will take place directly after the workshop in Saarbrücken. Beyond learning about latest ELM research at the conference, dedicated sessions will be organised in which workshop participants will have the opportunity to talk to international experts in small groups in order to build a scientific network and foster opportunities for collaboration. During the virtual workshop ""Your Project and Profile"" the participants will have the opportunity to present their project ideas to their peers as well as to experts in the ELM field. They will receive feedback to both, their project as well as to their profile as researcher in order to further develop and improve their own project proposal to be submitted to DFG in order to start their own, independent ELM research career. The experts participating in this virtual workshop will also be available for individual feedback and discussions in the subsequent grant writing phase. Target GroupThis programme targets doctoral researchers in their last year of PhD thesis and postdocs having obtained their PhD within the past four years with a background in material science, synthetic biology, biotechnology, biophysics, bioinformatics or complementary fields. In this stage, they have acquired research expertise in one particular field, and are about to initiate or just initiated a complementary training as next career step. The workshop for early career investigators will provide them an opportunity to initiate their own research programme in the emerging field of ELM, for which a rapidly increasing interest for qualified individuals in the academic and industrial job market is expected as consequence of the ""biological transformation"" of technology progresses. Given the interdisciplinary nature of ELM, we expect a diverse background of participants including materials sciences, synthetic biology, biophysics, or biotechnology. Application procedureInterested researchers are invited to attend the ""Virtual Information and Networking Event"" (18. 02. 2022) in order to obtain an introduction to the field of ELM, further information on the application procedure as well as the opportunity to network and initiate collaborations. Please sign up to the virtual event via email (see below, Further Information). Interested candidates are invited to submit the application as a single pdf file including the following documents via email (see below, Further Information)Cover Letter (1 page)Outline of the research idea in ELM: state-of-the-art, project aims, materials design, work plan, references (2 pages, Arial 10, single line spacing)Curriculum vitae (max. 2 pages including up to five most important publicationsCopy of the doctoral certificate or planned date for the PhD defenceStatement of the participant's PI that lab space will be provided in the case of fundingThe applications will be assessed by the organisers assisted by external referees. Up to 20 participants will be selected. The DFG grants typically comprise a full-time position for the applicant as well as funds for lab consumables and student assistants. The DFG grants applied for within the frame of this workshop will last for one year and are intended to initiate the research work and obtain preliminary data as a strong basis for follow-up funding frameworks such as DFG Eigene Stelle or Emmy Noether, or equivalent programmes at other funding institutions.

"In 2019, the Senate of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) established the Priority Programme ""Cooperative Multilevel Multistable Microactuator Systems (KOMMMA)"" (SPP 2206). The programme is designed to run for six years. The present call invites proposals for the second three-year funding period. Objectives of the Second Funding PeriodThe ongoing miniaturisation and the increasing demands on the functionalities of microsystems generate an urgent need for innovative approaches to control, for example, mechanics, optics or fluidics on a micrometer scale. An important prerequisite is the smart coupling of distributed microactuators into a cooperative synergetic actuation system. This opens the opportunity to generate new functionalities and thereby to tackle complex actuation tasks comprising combinations of force, displacement and dynamics that have not been possible until now. To date, various microactuators have been developed and are in use; yet, their systematic coupling to cooperative multistage or, for instance, multistable microactuator systems is still outstanding. In microsystems technology, substantial developments are currently carried out in sensors and sensor systems. The coherent cooperation of different microactuators will enable innovative ""smart"" systems solutions building a bridge to the success of today's sensor technology. The objectives of this interdisciplinary Priority Programme are to demonstrate new theoretically founded concepts to understand the complex coupling and synergy effects in cooperative microactuator systems as well as novel methods for the design, fabrication and control of cooperative and/or multistage microactuator systems. The development of bi-/multistable mechanisms will be required. The research of this Priority Programme focused so far on four core issues addressing different lengths and/or time scales:basic understanding of coupling effects and cross-sensitivities that arise from the spatially confined arrangement of diverse microactuators and corresponding functional materialsidentification and understanding of synergy effects resulting from promising combinations of microactuators, inherent sensing properties and multi-stable mechanismsdesign and evaluation of architectures of multifunctional actuator systems for microsystems applicationsmethods for the fabrication and control in microsystems applications including microtechnologies, integration and functionalisation of actuator materials and supporting structuresOrganisation and CooperationKOMMMA brings together research groups of the different research fields of microactuators, microsystems, materials science, system simulation, control and systems engineering and focuses their complementary expertise ranging from basic principles to demonstrator applications. Proposals should focus on the core issues 3) and/or 4) during the second funding period and either build on the understanding of coupling and synergy effects in the first period or introduce novel synergies. Joint proposals including cooperation across discipline borders will be encouraged. The number of principal investigators should reflect the complementary expertise needed for the proposed research. Proposals should aim at a comprehensive evaluation of cooperative multistage multistable microactuator systems (KOMMMA) addressing fundamental design parameters, engineering up to innovative demonstrator systems for applications in, e. g. , micromechanics, -optics and -fluidics. Proposals should not address the development of single actuators and developments exclusively on technologies, materials or simulation tools. Also, the development of any applications, e. g. robot and cyberphysical systems, will not be considered unless the proposals have a clear focus on cooperative multistage multistable microactuator systems. Proposal SubmissionProposals must be written in English and submitted to the DFG by 3 May 2022. Please note that proposals can only be submitted via elan, the DFG's electronic proposal processing system. Applicants must be registered in elan prior to submitting a proposal to the DFG. If you have not yet registered, please note that you must do so by 26 April 2022 to submit a proposal under this call; registration requests received after this time cannot be considered. You will normally receive confirmation of your registration by the next working day. Note that you will be asked to select the appropriate Priority Programme call during both the registration and the proposal process. If you would like to submit a proposal for a new project within the existing Priority Programme, please go to Proposal Submission - New Project - Priority Programmes and select ""SPP 2206 KOMMMA"" from the current list of calls. Previous applicants can submit a proposal for the renewal of an existing project under Proposal Submission - Proposal Overview/Renewal Proposal. In preparing your proposal, please review the programme guidelines (form 50. 05, section B) and follow the proposal preparation instructions (form 54. 01). These forms can either be downloaded from our website or accessed through the elan portal. The review colloquium for the Priority Programme will be held in June/July 2022 at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (COVID19 regulations permitting) or in virtual form. Details will be communicated through the programme's website.

"In the framework of the Infrastructure Priority Programme ""Exploratories for Large-Scale and Long-Term Functional Biodiversity Research"" (SPP 1374), established in 2006, the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) invites the submission of research grant proposals. Research in the Biodiversity Exploratories encompasses comparative, experimental and theoretical approaches, as well as scientific syntheses, addressing the following themes:relationships of land use and land-use intensity with all facets of biodiversity, from the genetic to the community level;consequences of changes in land use, land-use intensity and biodiversity for the functioning of ecosystems, communities, populations and for ecosystem services;the social-ecological context of the relations between land use, biodiversity and ecosystem services. The first fifteen years of Biodiversity Exploratories research have contributed to an in-depth understanding of land use - biodiversity - ecosystem functioning relationships. It revealed strong effects of land-use intensity on many facets of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in grasslands and forests and many similarities, but also pronounced differences, between study regions (see links below for further information). A more mechanistic understanding of land use - biodiversity - ecosystem functioning relationships is an important ambition for the new phase. The common research design and joint efforts of all involved projects provided an unprecedented density of information, samples, data and time series, which is all available to create added value with further research. Moreover, joint multi-site experiments in grasslands and forests are available for work toward further mechanistic insights. In addition to projects from the fields of the life sciences and natural sciences working on all aspects of the two first themes mentioned above, research is also welcome on the social-ecological context in which the relations between land use, biodiversity and ecosystem services are embedded. Such social-ecological research (e. g. on, but not limited to, social, economic, or governance aspects) should specifically address the context of the forest and grassland sites of the Biodiversity Exploratories. This call is addressing research groups with expertise in the research areas described above. The DFG will fund empirical projects addressing these topics using comparative, experimental or social-ecological approaches. Projects using theoretical approaches and projects aiming to create added value by scientific synthesis of existing data and information are encouraged, too. All projects should clearly relate to and use existing Biodiversity Exploratories' data, and aim at conceptual, causal and mechanistic advances. All proposals, i. e. new proposals as well as renewal proposals for Biodiversity Exploratories projects, must clearly describe how they will contribute to a causal and mechanistic understanding of the studied processes, how the planned research fits to the Biodiversity Exploratories conceptually, uses the common design, and complements existing research. To create added value, it is essential that all research projects make use of the common research design (see link to the research design below). This involves three study regions, the so-called Exploratories. In each Exploratory, 500 plots in forests and 500 plots in grasslands were initially surveyed, and their land use, soil, and vegetation were inventoried. Out of these 3,000 plots, 50 forest plots and 50 grassland plots were selected in each Exploratory (150 grassland plots and 150 forest plots overall) and established for intensive research. These so-called Experimental Plots represent the gradient of land-use intensities in the study regions. To contribute added value to the joint data base, all proposed research projects need to use all experimental plots in grasslands, or in forests, or both. For particularly labour-intensive investigations, the use of a predefined subset of plots (3 x 25 or 3 x 9 of the 150 grassland or forest plots; see website) may be planned. Proposed research may also make use of more than 300 of the initially inventoried 3,000 plots. Large manipulative multi-plot experiments (called REX, LUX and FOX) set-up in 2020 are also available, both in forests and in grasslands, and are open for joint use by all new projects. The rationale and design of these new experiments is detailed on the website (see link to the design of REX, LUX and FOX below). As the control plots of REX, LUX and FOX coincide with subsets of the Experimental Plots, it is very well possible to work on the large experiments as well as on the Experimental Plots. However, if the workload of working on all Experimental Plots and working on one or several of the large experiments would become unfeasible, projects may also work on either the Experimental Plots or one or more of the large experiments REX, LUX and FOX. Of course, further smaller-scale experiments are also welcome. These should be replicated in as many plots along the land-use intensity gradient as possible, to reveal how experimental treatment effects differ between regions and among sites of different land use and biodiversity. Before writing a proposal, investigators should consult Fischer et al. (2010), Basic and Applied Ecology, 11: 473-485, for a detailed description of the rationale and the design of the Exploratories, and the Exploratories' website for further information (link see below). New projects are strongly encouraged to take advantage of the large amount of data collected in the Exploratories over the last fifteen years. These data are managed in the Biodiversity Exploratories Information System (BExIS). Many data sets are publicly available there. Moreover, upon registration at BExIS, the metadata of not yet public datasets can also be explored (see link to BExIS below). The starting date proposed for all new projects is 1 March 2023. The duration of the projects should be 36 months, and cannot exceed this period. To foster collaboration and synergy successful applicants and their team members are expected to collaborate according to the rules of procedure of the Biodiversity Exploratories, to attend the annual assembly, and to actively participate in relevant workshops and thematic group discussions of the Biodiversity Exploratories. We ask you to send a very short summary of the intended research (applicant(s), preliminary title, plus a maximum of 5 lines of text) no later than 10 February 2022 by email to the speaker and the scientific coordinator of the Biodiversity Exploratories (see contacts below). To allow for mutual information and coordination among applicants these short summaries will be compiled and, in one password-protected file, made available to all applicants named in these summaries. On 23 February 2022, there will be an information event open to all potential applicants. This event will take place from 2 pm to 4 pm as a video conference. To register for this event please send an email to the scientific coordinator (see contact below). Presentations on the rationale, design and research of the Biodiversity Exploratories will be followed by a discussion of open questions. A summary of important information points from this event will be available on the project website soon after the event. Proposals must be written in English and submitted to the DFG by 27 April 2022. Please note that proposals can only be submitted via elan, the DFG's electronic proposal processing system. Applicants must be registered in elan prior to submitting a proposal to the DFG. If you have not yet registered, please note that you must do so by 6 April 2022 to submit a proposal under this call. You will normally receive confirmation of your registration by the next working day. Note that you will be asked to select the appropriate Priority Programme call during both the registration and the proposal process. If you would like to submit a proposal for a new project within the existing Priority Programme, please go to Proposal Submission - New Project - Priority Programmes and select ""SPP 1374"" from the current list of calls. Previous applicants can submit a proposal for the renewal of an existing project under Proposal Submission - Proposal Overview/Renewal Proposal. In preparing your proposal, please review the programme guidelines (form 50. 05, section B) and follow the proposal preparation instructions (form 54. 01). These forms can either be downloaded from our website or accessed through the elan portal. Please note that there is a new application template compared to the last application phase. Applications based on the old template cannot be accepted. The review colloquium for the Priority Programme will be held from 27 to 30 June 2022, attendance of applicants is envisaged for the 29 June 2022.

"The pursuit of scientific goals recognises no geographic boundaries and as such, international collaborations are today more the norm than the exception. To facilitate the support of collaborative work between US groups and their German counterparts, the Civil Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation Division of the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Division of Engineering of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) have agreed on a lead-agency activity in Advanced Manufacturing in 2020. US researchers are invited to read the Dear Colleague Letter NSF 22-013. In this information for researchers the extension of the existing cooperation NSF's Advanced Manufacturing programme and DFG's review board 401 Production Technology by DFG's review board 405 Materials Engineering is announced. Scope of the CollaborationUS-German collaborations are invited to submit joint proposals which fall into the scope NSF's Advanced Manufacturing programme and DFG's review boards 401 Production Technology or 405 Materials Engineering. These proposals will be reviewed in a review panel according to the NSF review guidelines (including the NSF review criteria) in competition with other proposals received in the same NSF programme. A member of DFG's review boards will be involved in the review process. It is important to note that there are no separate funds available for these efforts on each side; proposals must compete with all other proposals in this area. The result of the review process will be shared between the agencies to make final decisions on this basis. Support will be granted for those proposals with both DFG and NSF recommendation for funding. Proposal PreparationThe eligibility to submit a proposal follows the regulations for the NSF and DFG programmes for individual funding respectively. If in doubt, researchers are strongly encouraged to contact the corresponding programme officers. Proposals must be prepared in accordance with the proposal preparation requirements of the NSF. This includes a description of the full proposed research programme, and the research team, as well as the funds requested from the NSF. Please be aware that only this proposal will be reviewed. In parallel a supplement (max. 8 pages) must be prepared for the DFG. It must contain the information required in sections 4 to 5 of the DFG research grant project description - cf. DFG guidelines 53. 01 and 54. 01. This includes among other information the funds requested from DFG. The proposal must preface the title with ""NSF-DFG:"". Please note that for the part to be financed by DFG only those projects are eligible that fall within DFG's funding responsibility and that fit into the funding scheme ""Sachbeihilfe/Research Grants"". Applicants to be funded by the DFG are requested to fulfill the eligibility requirements of DFG Research Grants, see the corresponding guidelines of the Research Grants Programme (DFG form 50. 01). This includes the duty to cooperate (""Kooperationspflicht"") within Germany for members of non-university institutions with permanent positions. Transfer projects for DFG and GOALI projects for NSF are not possible in this collaboration. SubmissionProposals are accepted anytime. No specific deadlines apply. The proposal must first be submitted to NSF's Advanced Manufacturing programme via Fastlane. After receiving the proposal number issued by the NSF, the proposal has to be submitted to the DFG via elan. The submission to DFG must contain the full original proposal submitted to the NSF, the aforementioned supplement and a cover letter stating the NSF proposal number (this is needed for matching the submissions). The submission to DFG must select its primary subject area from the DFG review boards 401 or 405. Please note the DFG's data protection notice on research funding.

"Recognising the importance of international collaborations in promoting scientific discoveries, the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on research cooperation. The MoU provides for a Lead Agency arrangement whereby proposals may be submitted to either NSF or DFG. To facilitate the support of collaborative work between US researchers and their German counterparts, the Division of Molecular and Cellular Bioscience (BIO/MCB) at NSF and the Division of Molecular and Organismal Biology and Agriculture (MOBA) at the DFG are pleased to announce a Lead Agency activity in the area of molecular and cell biology. The Lead Agency scheme allows for reciprocal acceptance of peer review through unsolicited mechanisms and its goal is to help reduce some of the current barriers to working internationally. US researchers are invited to read the Dear Colleague Letter NSF 22-015 (see link below). ScopeUS-German collaborations are invited to submit joint proposals in the areas covered by BIO/MCB and the DFG's review board 201 ""Basic Research in Biology and Medicine"". The proposals should focus on basic research at a molecular, subcellular or cellular level, including theoretical approaches. Proposals encompassing tissues, organs or whole animals cannot be considered. Research in the area of plant sciences, microbiology, immunology and neurosciences is also excluded. Proposals must provide a clear rationale for the need for a US-German collaboration, including the unique expertise and synergy that the collaborating groups will bring to the project. Timeline for SubmissionsProposals can be submitted from 3 January 2022 on a continuous base. Please note that there is no deadline for submission to either agency. Submission and ReviewThe prospective investigators should discuss within their research team where they believe the largest portion of the research lies and agree on a Lead Agency (either NSF or DFG). The proposers identify the Lead Agency, develop a joint proposal in accordance with the chosen Lead Agency's standard rules and submit it to the Lead Agency following its submission procedures. Regardless of which organisation will serve as the Lead Agency for the proposal, German and US applicants are subject to DFG and NSF standard eligibility and programme requirements respectively. Lead Agency proposals are reviewed in accordance with the general rules of the Lead Agency's relevant funding programme. Proposals will be assessed in competition with all others submitted to the normal funding opportunity round, and outcomes will be subject to both success in peer review and the availability of funds from both DFG/MOBA and NSF/BIO/MCB. The Lead Agency will make reviews and assessments available to the non-Lead Agency as a basis for a joint discussion on the project's success. Information on Submitting Proposals to DFGPlease note that the rules for funding eligibility apply to all proposers from Germany, including the duty to cooperate for non-university researchers. Any duty to cooperate for DFG applicants at non-university research institutions can only be fulfilled through cooperation with a partner at a German university/higher education institution (see DFG form 55. 01). The DFG allows a maximum funding period of 36 months. Both US and German investigators should consider this requirement when structuring their proposals and considering the alignment of projects. The review, evaluation and decision processes on the funds applied for from the DFG will follow the rules and regulations of the individual grants programme (see link below) and funding notices will depend on the adherence to the same reporting and appropriation regulations (see DFG form 2. 00). If DFG is the Lead AgencyPlease prepare the proposal according to the guidelines for the Research Grants Programme (see link below). Proposals must be submitted via elan, the DFG's electronic proposal processing system. Please select ""NSF-DFG MolCellBio"" under ""Proposal Data"" (DO NOT select WEAVE). Enter a project acronym for your proposal. For each module, please only enter the funds requested from the DFG. Note that only Germany-based applicants should be entered as ""applicants"". International partners should be entered as ""cooperation partners"". A biographical sketch for each of the applying individuals should be provided, formatted according to the DFG guidelines for publication lists (see DFG form 1. 91). The proposal must include a description of the full proposed research programme and research team, and the total resources for the joint project (meaning the funds requested for the US and German side). Letter(s) of Collaboration from participating US project partner(s) should be included. A separate document, the Justification of Resources, should include a clear summary and justification of the funds to be requested from NSF. NSF will only request copies of proposals that are to be awarded, after the funding decision is made. NSF will ask that the US PI prepare and submit the proposal that was reviewed by DFG, in accordance with the guidance contained in NSF 22-1 Proposal & Award Policies and Procedures Guide (PAPPG) (see link below). If NSF is Lead AgencyWhile being a separate activity, the NSF-DFG MolCellBio Lead Agency activity is administered at the DFG similar to the WEAVE Programme, therefore please refer to DFG form 54. 019en and follow the instructions therein (under ""Submitting proposals to international funding organisations as Lead Agency""), including the submission of the project data form. A copy of the proposal, which was submitted to the NSF, must be submitted to the DFG within one week (or the proposal may otherwise be rejected for formal reasons). For information on submitting proposals to the NSF, please refer to the Dear Colleague Letter NSF 22-015 (see link below). Notification of resultsApplicants will be informed in writing of the decision and, where applicable, of the subsequent administrative steps according to the respective national regulations.

"In March 2018, the Senate of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) established the Priority Programme ""Dynamic Wetting of Flexible, Adaptive and Switchable Surfaces"" (SPP 2171). The programme is designed to run for six years. The present call invites proposals for the second three-year funding period. The dynamic process of liquids wetting or dewetting various substrates is ubiquitous in everyday life and of key importance in many technological applications and natural systems. Earlier work mostly focused on the influence of the topography and composition of rigid and inert substrates. Recent developments in areas like microelectronics and 3D printing have demonstrated a pressing need to also understand cases in which (de)wetting dynamics and substrate dynamics are strongly coupled. This holds true especially on microscopic and mesoscopic length scales, where (non)equilibrium surface phenomena dominate. The Priority Programme aims at establishing a deeper understanding of the fundamental physics behind the dynamic (de)wetting of flexible, adaptive and switchable substrates combining experimental and theoretical perspectives. The focus lies on rather simple liquids that shall be employed to investigate the different cases of strong coupling between liquid hydrodynamics and (primarily reversible) substrate dynamics. The investigation will further develop the foundations for developing future technologies and for understanding biological systems that utilise and control such wetting phenomena. Flexible substrates experience deformations due to the traction that a (de)wetting liquid exerts on them, which in turn experiences an altered geometry. Thus, static and dynamic (de)wetting processes are governed by this two-way coupling between liquid and substrate. This holds true for elastomeric materials, hydrogels, or slippery liquid infused porous surfaces, and is even amplified for substrates that expose ""hairy"" structures. In contrast, adaptive substrates change their physico-chemical properties due to the presence of a liquid. This may be induced by direct contact like under a sessile droplet, or it may be mediated through an external phase like the ambient atmosphere or a second liquid. Typical modification agents are temperature or ambient humidity. The functional surfaces of many carnivorous plants belong to this category, as well as swellable polymer gels or surfaces with grafted polymer brushes. Finally, switchable substrates alter their physico-chemical properties upon exposure to an external influence. For instance, switching could be induced by electric or magnetic fields, as well as via changes of pH or temperature. For instance, nematic elastomers or coatings that contain photoswitchable azobenzenes fall into this category. Often, real model systems cannot be clearly assigned to a single category, but exhibit features of several of them. The common base of all three categories is a strong coupling between (de)wetting hydrodynamics and substrate processes. This typically introduces additional time- and length scales that do not exist in the (de)wetting of inert and rigid substrates. Strong couplings also impact the mechanisms of energy dissipation, potentially altering the dynamics on a global scale. To allow for a clear identification of these coupling mechanisms, projects shall normally focus on relatively simple, low-molecular-weight liquids. This includes the mixtures of such liquids and dilute suspensions or tenside solutions that offer novel coupling mechanisms through their internal degrees of freedom. This Priority Programme invites experimental, numerical, and theoretical contributions from all natural sciences and mathematics. Projects should aim at a fundamental understanding of the dynamics of three phase contact lines on flexible, adaptive or switchable substrates. To keep the programme coherent, it shall not support projects that exclusively aim at application development or biological systems. Also, the focus shall be on the coupling of liquid and substrate dynamics, for liquids that as such are already well understood. Furthermore, the substrate dynamics shall normally be reversible which, e. g. , excludes processes based on irreversible chemical reactions or permanent mechanical change. The questions that are addressed in the programme are highly interdisciplinary, reaching from materials science to theoretical physics of liquids. Both, experimentalists and theoreticians, face the challenges of phenomena that are inherently multiscale, where physico-chemical processes at the microscale determine the evolution on the macroscopic scale.

"In April 2017, the Senate of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) established the Priority Programme ""Entangled Africa: Intra-African connections between Rainforest and Mediterranean (ca. 6,000 to 500 BP)"" (SPP 2143). The programme is designed to run for six years. The present call invites proposals for the second three-year funding period. Background and scientific objectivesAfrica is a source of various cultural inspirations and innovations making it from the archaeological point of view a hot spot in the research of human history. However, well studied areas and periods are juxtaposed with virtually unknown regions and little understood contexts. To date, study of these contexts has been predominantly characterised by an extra-African, e. g. European or Near Eastern, perspective. This Priority Programme attempts a fundamental change in perspective. The main objective of the programme is to render visible the multilayered entanglement of wide ranging contacts in the African past between the Mediterranean and the rainforest. Entanglements and interactions which had a formative influence on human societies during the last 6,000 years are studied with the help of a wide spectrum of multidisciplinary methods. Methodological frameworkThe Priority Programme is a coordinated project dealing with archaeological research issues. Its members work in close collaboration with their African partners. Since the programme studies entanglements, projects and research questions should be conceived on a supraregional scale. There are three main aspects:Which indicators of interregional contacts and entanglements can be detected?The question aims at identifying indicators that represent interregional contacts (e. g. nonlocal objects and materials whose origin remains to be clarified; agents that become visible by the dissemination of innovative technologies such as food production, pottery/iron manufacturing or architecture or are proven by written records). Which forms do these interactions and entanglements take?The organisation of interactions, their spatial distribution, time depth and infrastructure are analysed (e. g. mechanisms, like the mobility pattern behind the contact: migration, exchange or trade; the answering of questions regarding the cause and motivation behind mobility). Which patterns can be detected?What territories are connected to each other, during which period of time and on the basis of which mechanisms? At this point we focus on the particular environmental and social impact factors during the last 6,000 years (e. g. the effect of geographical position; which climate and environmental changes as well as transformations within human societies formed entanglement mechanisms). ApplicationProposals must fit with the spatial and temporal framework of the Priority Programme: northern hemisphere Africa between the Mediterranean and the rainforest between 6,000 and 500 years BP. At least one of the three entanglement aspects defined above must be a central point in the proposal. Thus coherence and connectivity between participants can be ensured. Collaborations between projects, which have enrolled in the first phase (see link below) or applying for the second phase of the programme are welcome and should be mentioned in the proposal. Please note that the overall financial framework for the call for proposals is limited. Proposals must be written in English and submitted to the DFG by 31 January 2021. Please note that proposals can only be submitted via elan, the DFG's electronic proposal processing system. In addition to submitting your proposal via elan, please send an electronic copy to the programme coordinators (see below). Applicants must be registered in elan prior to submitting a proposal to the DFG. If you have not yet registered, please note that you must do so by 17 January 2021 to submit a proposal under this call; registration requests received after this time cannot be considered. You will generally receive confirmation of your registration by the next working day. Note that you will be asked to select the ""SPP 2143 - Entangled Africa: Intra-African connections between Rainforest and Mediterranean (ca. 6,000 to 500 BP)"" call during both the registration and the proposal process. If you would like to submit a proposal for a new project within the existing Priority Programme, please go to ""Proposal Submission - New Project - Priority Programmes"" and select ""SPP 2143"" from the current list of calls.

"In May 2020, the Senate of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) established the Priority Programme ""Theoretical Foundations of Deep Learning"" (SPP 2298). The programme is designed to run for six years. The present call invites proposals for the first three-year funding period. We currently witness the impressive success of deep learning in real-world applications, ranging from autonomous driving over game intelligence to the health care sector. At the same time, deep learning-based methods have a similarly strong impact on science, often replacing state-of-the-art classical model-based methods to solve mathematical problems such as inverse problems or partial differential equations. However, despite this outstanding success, most of the research on deep neural networks is empirically driven and mathematical foundations are largely missing. Moreover, in several special but important cases these techniques dramatically fail under small perturbations such as adversarial examples in image classification, which calls for improvements driven by a theoretical underpinning. The key goal of this Priority Programme is the development of a comprehensive theoretical foundation of deep learning. The research within the programme will be structured along three complementary points of view, namelythe statistical point of view regarding neural network training as a statistical learning problem and studying expressivity, learning, optimisation, and generalisation,the applications point of view focusing on safety, robustness, interpretability, and fairness, andthe mathematical methodologies point of view developing and theoretically analysing novel deep learning-based approaches to solve inverse problems and partial differential equations. The research questions to be addressed within this Priority Programme are of a truly interdisciplinary nature and can only be solved by a joint effort of mathematics and computer science. Mathematical methods and models throughout mathematics are required, including algebraic geometry, analysis, applied probability, approximation theory, differential geometry, discrete mathematics, functional analysis, optimal control, optimisation, and topology. A fundamental role is similarly played by statistics as well as theoretical computer science. In this sense, methods from mathematics, statistics, and computer science are at the core of this Priority Programme. Successful proposals address a genuine contribution to the understanding and the theoretical foundations of deep learning along the above three complementary points of view. Projects aiming ""only"" at the application of existing methods of deep learning or their further development without theoretical foundations may not be funded in the frame of the programme. Proposals must be written in English and submitted to the DFG by 30 November 2020. Please note that proposals can only be submitted via ""elan"", the DFG's electronic proposal processing system. To enter a new proposal within the existing Priority Programme, go to Proposal Submission - New Project/Draft Proposal - Priority Programmes and select ""SPP 2298"" from the current list of calls. Applicants must be registered in ""elan"" prior to submitting a proposal to the DFG. If you have never before submitted a proposal to DFG through ""elan"", you need to register in advance. This can be done online by yourself - however, it takes one to two working days to be confirmed by DFG staff. If you need to register, please complete your registration before 16 November 2020. Note that you will be asked to select the appropriate Priority Programme call during both the registration and the proposal process. If your contact data in ""elan"" is outdated, please also update it before that date. General information on proposals in the framework of a Priority Programme (in particular concerning eligibility and admissible funding requests) can be found in guideline 50. 05 (part B). See also guideline 54. 01 for instructions how to prepare a proposal. The specific proposal has to be structured according to form 53. 01. However, it is admissible to prepare the proposal as a pdf-file, e. g. , using LaTeX, instead of using the rtf-file which is available online. Note that the descriptions of the projects and all CVs need to be prepared in English. Further, DFG's rules for publication lists (guideline 1. 91) need to be respected: Beside the general bibliography, every proposal should include a list of up to ten publications by the applicant(s) (and/or members of her/his/their group) that relate directly to the project. Any academic CV submitted to the DFG must not list more than ten publications, which describe best the scientist's profile. Publications in these lists need to be classified as a) refereed publications (published articles and monographs; accepted articles with note of acceptance by the journal) or b) other publications (e. g. , preprints on arXiv), which need to be accessible online (please mention the arXiv number or provide links). With the submission of a proposal within this programme, the applicants agree that DFG shares all necessary information with the coordinator of the Priority Programme after the call deadline. Due to the Coronavirus-pandemic the review will not take place in form of a colloquium. It is planned to have a video review meeting by a confidential international review panel in Spring 2021. It is expected to submit additional posters for the suggested projects in due time before the virtual panel meeting that e. g. may also contain updated information regarding latest publications. Information about the poster format and submission date will be given later to the applicants by the coordinator of the Priority Programme. The decision about the projects will be reached in the summer of 2021.

A lack of education can block the development of children and society as a whole. Child labour is a result of poverty and an important cause. The UN Sustainable Development Goals state that child labour should be eliminated by 2025 at the latest. With FBK, your business can help achieve this goal by ending child labour.

Background FVO provides support in two different ways: Pillar 1 and Pillar 2. Pillar 1 supports partnerships between companies and civil society organisations. FVO aims to set up multi-stakeholder projects to identify and stop RBC risks or misconduct in international value chains. Pillar 2 is available in Dutch only. For more information on Pillar 2, see the Dutch information page on FVO Partnerships Pillar 2. Around the world, numerous RBC risks and misconducts can be found in the value chains of Dutch companies. Such as harm to the natural environment through pollution or reduction of biodiversity, human rights violations during land acquisitions and poor working conditions in factories in producer countries. Individual companies or civil society organisations cannot tackle misconduct in international value chains alone. Collaboration is required to amplify the impact and leverage in the value chains. Joint efforts such as these facilitate better implementation of due diligence (appropriate care with RBC issues) into the business processes of Dutch companies. This has a positive impact on local manufacturing conditions in producer countries. On AidData, you can find an overview of projects that we carry out in development cooperation. You can filter by location, sector and programme, among others.

"Changed on: 15-11-2021 Innovative products and ideas can help resolve societal issues and increase wealth. A crucial phase in the process is the step from idea to starting up product development: creating and verifying commercial concepts, identifying suitable markets and developing the right patents (IPs as defined by Bradley et al. 2013). For innovative startups, we call this phase the proof-of-concept phase. For existing SMEs, this phase is called the innovation phase. Proof-of-concept funding is there to ensure that an idea develops from the planning phase into the startup phase. What is Proof-of-concept funding? Startups and SMEs can use a loan from the Proof-of-concept funding scheme to examine whether their idea is potentially feasible in the market. The loan plus the interest have to be repaid. The interest rate is 4. 55% (as of 1 January 2021). The EU-reference percentage is variable and is set by the European Commission. Target groups Both startups and established businesses can benefit from the Proof-of-concept funding. Proof-of-concept funding is aimed at three target groups:SMEsinnovative startups (max 5 years old)academic, hbo (polytechnic) and TO2 innovative startups (whose economic activities directly and immediately benefit from research by a university or academic hospital) Budget For the period 1 January up to and including 31 December 2021, a budget of €6 million has been set aside for Proof-of-concept funding for SMEs and innovative startups. For academic, polytechnic and TO2 start-ups there is €2. 75 million available for the period 4 January up to and including 9 March 2021. Applications SMEs and innovative startups can submit an application from 1 January up to and including 31 December 2021, 17:00 CET.

"Changed on: 27-12-2021 Are you an entrepreneur and do you want to benefit from a tax scheme for investing in environmentally-friendly technology? You may be eligible for the Environmental investment deduction (MIA) and Arbitrary depreciation of environmental investments (Vamil) schemes. Through MIA, you can deduct up to 45% of the investment costs for an environmentally friendly investment on top of your regular investment tax deductions. With Vamil, you can decide when to write off 75% of your investment costs. This gives you an advantage in liquidity and interest. Budget The MIA budget for 2022 is €144 million. The Vamil budget for 2022 is €25 million. For all entrepreneurs All entrepreneurs in the Netherlands who pay income or company tax can use MIA and Vamil. The tax scheme is interesting for entrepreneurs in different sectors, such as agriculture, industry, catering companies, business services and waste processing. But, also for those who invest in circular economy, sustainable transport, sustainable recreation and sustainable buildings. Conditions To be eligible for MIA and Vamil, you must meet the following conditions:You are an entrepreneur in the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten or one of the BES islands and you pay income or corporation tax. You invest in a business asset that is on the Environment List that applies on the date that you commit to the investment. The business asset meets the requirements set by the Environment List for the investment. You provide permits or certificates if the description on the Environment List requires this. You report the business asset on time (main rule: within 3 months after the order for delivery). The asset has not been used before. The investment costs for the asset to be reported amount to a minimum of €2,500. Environment list Do you want to know which investments apply to MIA and Vamil? See this year's Environment list (in Dutch). The investments on the Environment list, called business assets, are minimally damaging to the environment. They often have a wider scope than the obligations in the law. Submit your product to the Environment list Have you developed an innovative, environmentally-friendly product or company resource that you want to put on the market? Submit your product to the Environment list. If your product is on the Environment List, your customers in the Netherlands can get a tax benefit. This lowers the financial threshold for the investment. Companies can make proposals to include a product or business asset on the next Environment list. To be considered for the list, the environmental investment has to:have a clear yield for the environment;be innovative or still have a smaller market share than the conventional product; andbe more expensive than the environmentally friendly alternative. A new Environment list appears every year. Investments that no longer meet the MIA and Vamil requirements as a result of technological advances, will be removed from the list or adapted, and new innovative investments will be added. Your product may be one of the newcomers. Read more information about submitting products or company resources for the next Environment list on our proposal Environment list page.

"Changed on: 25-03-2022 Reversing the Flow (RtF) supports communities in vulnerable situations by strengthening their water security. RtF aims at making communities stronger with water and climate adaptation actions. The idea is that communities will organise and lead these actions themselves. Local partners will create hubs to support the communities. Aim and strategy RtF's strategy has 3 pillars: The programme offers:FundingRtF funds organisations (hubs) that support communities with water security initiatives. Knowledge exchange and training coursesRtF facilitates knowledge exchange and training courses:across informal communities within a watershed or landscape;between communities and local governments, utility companies, civil societies, and development partners or Community Based Organisations (CBOs);between watersheds or landscapes at the programme level. Engaging dialoguesRtF facilitates and engages in policy dialogues at various levels: multilateral, national and local. This way, interventions result in sustainable and inclusive development for the communities involved. Target groups RtF supports the resilient livelihoods of communities in vulnerable situations in the target countries. Target countries Reversing the Flow will carry out its programme in 4 to 6 countries. The programme will start in Burkina Faso, Kenya and Sudan. The potential target countries are:BangladeshBurkina FasoEthiopiaJordanKenyaMaliMozambiqueNigeriaSudanUganda. Who can apply for funding? We will select hubs interested in supporting local initiatives and meet the criteria. HubsHubs are local partners that support communities. The funding goes to local communities that come up with and carry out their initiatives through the hubs. Hubs have to meet the following standards:be independent, self-steering mature civil society organisations or multi-stakeholder platforms;operate at a landscape or watershed scale;have a record of accomplishment in working with grassroots organisation networks in resilience, water management, climate change and nature-based solutions;follow the agreed management standards and obligations. Hubs fulfil more than one role in RtF as they:help their network of grassroots organisations develop a portfolio of interventions following RtF's aims;coordinate and monitor the implementation of the interventions;operate as small grant providers to the grassroots organisations;hold grassroots organisations accountable for the use of the funding;help networking and exchange of knowledge between grassroots organisations within a landscape;help grassroots organisations participate in policy dialogue with local authorities and private sector initiatives at the landscape and watershed level;discuss the learning agenda with the knowledge partners;subcontract and supervise technical assistance providers;report to the Netherlands Enterprise Agency on the progress. RtF may choose to work with more than one hub per landscape. For example, one organisation with a proven track record in the implementation process and another can facilitate policy dialogue. RtF will also have the flexibility to select more than one landscape per country. This method may provide economies of scale and reduce overhead costs. Grassroots organisationsGrassroots are people united in society, a movement or an organisation. They communicate with their local stakeholders to resolve livelihood, water security or climate adaptation challenges. Also, grassroots organisations help communities with their needs, implementation plans and budgets. In RtF, grassroots organisations will build networks, interact with peers, and:work together with the hub in their landscape;manage the funding allocated by the hub;follow agreed management standards and obligations;coordinate and monitor community-level implementation; andaccount for funds received. Knowledge partnersKnowledge partners cannot apply for funding. Yet, they are an important factor in the successful outcome of RtF initiatives. The knowledge partners will:help the implementing partners define meaningful learning objectives;seek alignment with existing learning structures in the respective countries;develop links with the hubs and help set up connections between hubs across landscapes. More information on RtF Are you interested in Reversing the Flow? Do you meet the criteria for a hub? Contact us for more information on funding. You may also contact the embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in your country. SDGs RtF contributes to the following SDGs:SDG 5: Gender equalitySDG 6: Clean water and sanitationSDG 13: Climate actionSDG 15: Life on land. Gender is an essential criterion for the selection of communities. RtF aims to break through existing power structures by empowering women, youth and disadvantaged ethnic groups. It will focus on new initiatives where local communities, especially women, are in the lead. Looking for inspiration? Have a look at other programmes in our IATI database. "

The objectives of PSI were to stimulate financial growth, create employment opportunities and generate income. The grant was accessible for (Dutch and non-Dutch) companies in order to make an innovative pilot investment, in cooperation with a local business partner, in many countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe. Results In the past 15 years, many companies have used the PSI subsidy and its forerunners such as PSOM. The Netherlands Enterprise Agency has supported more than 1,000 private investment projects in Africa, Asia, Latin-America and Central and Eastern Europe. These projects have contributed significantly to the economic development and poverty reduction on these continents. Evaluation An evaluation in 2010 by an independent organisation proved that:69% of the projects were successful at the end of the project period;An estimated 57% of all projects resulted in a durable business, seeing that they were still existing 7 to 10 years after the project had started;On average, a PSI/PSOM project created 81 jobs (direct employment), and after follow-up investments even 30% more jobs were created;In general, PSI projects served as a good example to other companies regarding Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). PSI projects offered employment standards that were above average, including salary, benefits and education. Many projects also encouraged the use of standards and certificatons in these countries;At the end of the project, the project partners made follow-up investments 1,22 times the initial subsidy amount.

"Changed on: 11-05-2021 The European Partnership for Responsible Minerals (EPRM) is a multi-stakeholder partnership. EPRM was established to create better social and economic conditions for mine workers and local mining communities. It does this by increasing the number of mines that adopt responsible mining practices in Conflict and High-Risk Areas (CAHRAs). Call for proposals There are no calls for proposals at this moment. Background information EPRM is a multi-stakeholder partnership. Its objective is to increase responsibly produced minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas (CAHRAs). EPRM also aims to support the socially responsible extraction of minerals that contributes to local development. Why EPRM?EPRM helps with the EU Conflict Minerals Regulation, as the regulation alone is not enough to make a real change. EPRM supports mine sites in CAHRAs. The aim of this support is to enable more mines to follow the standards required by OECD Due Diligence Guidance. This will then allow companies to source minerals from the mines while also following relevant regulations. EPRM focusses on tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold (3TG). ActionsTo reach its objectives, EPRM focusses on 3 actions:1. Supporting mine sites - Responsible productionArtisanal and small-scale mines (ASMs) are given support to produce more responsibly. This gives them access to formal markets at local and international levels. 2. Supporting companies - Responsible sourcingMid- and downstream actors are given support to improve their due diligence practices to source 3TG responsibly. Support is given via capacity building and cross-sectoral learning, for example. 3. Linking production and sourcingImproved links are created between supply chain actors. This encourages trade from ASMs in CAHRAs. On AidData you can find an overview of projects that we carry out in the field of development cooperation. You can filter by location, sector and programme, among others.

"Changed on: 28-10-2019 The Special Envoy for International Water Affairs, Henk Ovink and the Netherlands Enterprise Agency (on behalf of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) have taken on the challenge of addressing water crises in urban areas. The programme Water as Leverage for Resilient Cities Asia is collaborating with the cities of Chennai (India), Khulna (Bangladesh) and Semarang (Indonesia) to tackle urban water-related challenges in an innovative and inclusive way. The programme invited internationally operating multidisciplinary teams to develop innovative, bankable and implementable design proposals. Actual implementation is the final aim. To achieve this, Water as Leverage entered a partnership with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Dutch Development Bank FMO, 100ResilientCities, Partners for Resilience, Architecture Workroom Brussels, International Architecture Biennale Rotterdam and the Global Center on Adaptation. Furthermore, Water as Leverage for Resilient Cities Asia is supported by the UN/World Bank High Level Panel on Water. Visit the Water as Leverage website to find out more and keep up-to-date with developments. Call for Action On World Earth Day (22 April 2018) Water as Leverage launched its first call. It is no longer possible to submit a bid. Water as Leverage now enters the next phase. Six international teams of water and climate experts, engineers, scientists, architects and urban planners have been selected to develop groundbreaking, innovative approaches to tackle the immense climate and water challenges in three cities in Asia: Semarang (Indonesia), Khulna (Bangladesh) and Chennai (India).

The challenge Water represents the most challenging and complex risk faced by man. Floods and droughts, pollution and water conflicts combined with a growing demand for food and energy, rapid urbanisation, migration pressures, and climate change are potentially catastrophic. Yet, the connecting and interdependent strength of water provides us with an opportunity that cannot be ignored: water can be used as leverage for impactful and catalytic change. The challenge is to match long-term comprehensive urban planning with short term innovative transformations; ambitious climate adaptation plans with bankable projects; the development of more knowledge on water systems with the construction of more resilient cities; research, design and implementation with inclusive urban alliances. Result-driven collaboration is essential - across all sectors, all layers of government, and all stakeholders - from activists and vulnerable communities to private and public institutions. The programme Water is the leverage for climate impact, yet 'it takes millions to invest billions wisely' - that is the conviction of the Netherlands Special Envoy for International Water Affairs, Mr Henk Ovink. The programme Water as Leverage will provide these catalytic first millions, with the aim of developing conceptual designs that will leverage water for real urban climate resilience. The three cities where Water as Leverage is to begin, will pilot a transformative design approach with a view towards replication of its principles, in Asia and the wider world. The initiative involves a dedicated group of partners from governments, financial institutions, investors and community stakeholders committed to the aim of replicating Water as Leverage in other cities and regions. The President of the AIIB, Jin Liqun, put it like this:""Asia is at a critical juncture. Its role on the world stage is increasing, but the region now faces new and complex challenges. We will not, and cannot, change the course of the planet alone, but we will step up, alongside other members and partners, to do our part to build a sustainable tomorrow. ""Water as Leverage wants to be different. Aiming to involve the international financial world, development banks and governments in the advancement of this innovative approach. Creating an inclusive and innovative pre-project preparation facility. Using water as leverage for making cities resilient. Background The initially selected cities, Chennai (India), Khulna (Bangladesh) and Semarang (Indonesia), all face complex water-related challenges. All related to, or on top of rapid urbanisation and unprecedented migration flows. This challenging landscape of problems and opportunities is the focus of the first design competition. Not against each other, but for the highest ambition, to find the best resiliency approach. "

"Changed on: 23-03-2021 The European Union's policies and programmes aim for a healthy population. A healthy population is vital to a stable, sustainable and inclusive society. But health care costs are under pressure. This is due to demographic changes and rising prevention costs for chronic diseases. The worldwide pandemic also adds to the increasing health care costs. Health care systems reveal vulnerabilities in our social and economic system. They also reveal the urgency to act. Health care systems, professionals and citizens play an important role in responding to society's needs. Their actions serve society and help the economy. Cluster 1 of the Horizon Europe Framework programme 2021-2022 addresses these challenges. Calls for proposals The programme has 6 goals (expected impacts):Stay healthy in a rapidly changing society;Live and work in a health-promoting environment;Tackle diseases and reduce disease burdens;Unlock the full potential of new tools, technologies and digital solutions for a healthy society;Ensure access to innovative, sustainable and high-quality health care; andMaintain an innovative, sustainable and globally competitive health-related industry. The programme aims to reach these goals through calls for proposals and dedicated partnerships. The European Commission will publish the calls for proposals throughout the period of 2021 and 2022. See the European Commission's Funding and Tender opportunities portal for the calls. Questions or advice? The Netherlands Enterprise Agency hosts the National Contact Point (NCP) for Horizon Europe.

They learn about cleaner cooking solutions and small solar energy systems. The programme also supports the construction of electricity connections via mini-grids. EnDev also stimulates the production of biogas for household purposes. Outcome-oriented The EnDev programme focuses on supply and demand. On the demand side, the programme creates awareness and supports the introduction of new business models such as PAYGO, consumer loans and so on. On the supply side, projects provide the quality and availability of these energy products. The EnDev programme has no subsidy component. It publishes specific calls for proposals in the form of result-based financing. EnDev results EnDev aims to achieve sustainable access to modern energy for 27. 5 million people by 2022.

"Changed on: 08-12-2021 Are you an entrepreneur who wants to contribute to the construction of public infrastructure in a developing country? Whether you need support for a project concerning food security, clean water, sexual and reproductive health and rights or the climate, you may be eligible for a subsidy or guarantee from the DRIVE programme. Update: As of 1 October 2021, the Netherlands Enterprise Agency has handed over this programme to Invest International. Find out more about this change. Facilitating investments in infrastructural projects With DRIVE, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs facilitates investments in infrastructural projects that contribute towards a good business climate and entrepreneurship in the priority sectors: water, climate, food security, and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR). Public infrastructure projects that have a high development relevance in other sectors also can apply for DRIVE support. Projects must be supportive of and built on the Dutch agenda for aid, trade and investment. For example by joining initiatives that have already been developed as part of Dutch development policy. The overall objective of DRIVE is to contribute to inclusive and sustainable growth in developing countries. DRIVE supports investments in expansion and/or quality improvement of public infrastructure that improve the development of the private sector by promoting entrepreneurship, productivity and employment opportunities, and by lifting wages. For whom DRIVE is open for application from companies all over the world. You cannot apply when your company is located in a country or active in a sector that is subject to UN or EU sanctions. Entrepreneurs who wish to qualify for a public infrastructure construction contract in one of the DRIVE countries may submit applications for DRIVE. Selection criteria To qualify for DRIVE, the project and your company should meet the following selection criteria:The project demonstrably contributes to private sector development. By improving the business climate, people are enabled to start up an entrepreneurship whereby employment and productivity increase. The project thereby enables people to better provide for themselves;You undertake to comply with the OECD Guidelines on International Corporate Social Responsibility (ICSR) for multinationals when implementing projects. These guidelines set out what the Dutch government expects of businesses in their international activities;The project fits the policy objectives of the target country or region;The project meets the needs of the targeted end-users;Your company demonstrably has the expertise, is reliable, has financial standing and stability to carry out the project. How to apply For information on how to apply, contact Invest International. Budget For the period 2019 until 31 December 2021, a commitment budget of €150 million is available. The budget is fixed each year by means of publication in the Government Gazette. Projects are sized between €5 million and €60 million, including financing costs. Types of financial supportThe financial DRIVE support can include grants, guarantees and loans. Subsidy amountThe subsidy is based on the DRIVE country's income category (OECD-DAC classification). The subsidy is expressed as a percentage of the nominal value of the loan for the financing of the DRIVE project. This percentage is a maximum of 20% for Upper and Middle Income Countries (UMIC), 35% for Lower and Middle Income Countries (LMIC), and 50% for Least-Developed Countries (LDC). CostsAll financing costs, such as premiums and insurance, have to be included in the project budget. DRIVE does not cover the operation and maintenance costs. However, DRIVE wants to ascertain that the projected infrastructure will be sustainable in the long run. For this reason, an O&M Plan needs to be submitted during the DRIVE intake procedure. DRIVE and D2B Both DRIVE and Develop 2 Build (D2B) are programmes of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs aimed at promoting development-related public infrastructure in countries as specified on a list of eligible countries. Whereas most countries on the D2B list are Least-Developed Countries, the DRIVE list also includes Lower-Middle Income Countries and Upper-Middle Income Countries. Other important differences are the target group, the project phase, and the financing. DRIVE is open to companies wanting to participate in a tender for the realisation of public infrastructure. It facilitates the financing of projects through subsidies, guarantees and loans, which can be awarded after an intake and assessment procedure, when both companies and projects fulfil all DRIVE requirements. D2B also provides grants to local governments for the development of project plans for public infrastructure that have a high development relevance.

"Home > Projects > How to Apply for Funding How to Apply for Funding from EOCA Applications for funding are invited from 1-15 June and 1-15 November. EOCA will next be accepting funding applications from 1 - 15 JUNE 2022, for funding in autumn 2022. Please keep checking this page for any further updates. There is an increasing urgency and awareness of the double threat that our world currently faces: the loss of biodiversity and climate change. These two issues are intrinsically linked, and both are of enormous importance to wildlife, nature, people and the future of the planet. Imagine standing at a viewpoint, looking out at the environment around you. You can see the highest mountains, the valleys between them, the streams that become a meandering river leading to a lake, to an estuary and then out to the ocean. Within this landscape are a wide variety of different ecosystems, vital for biodiversity, mitigating against climate change, and for communities. These include alpine meadows, forests, peatlands, freshwater habitats, salt marshes, mangroves and seagrass meadows, to name but a few. EOCA is looking to fund projects which benefit biodiversity in a wild landscape. Our definition of 'landscape' includes marine environments, and a broad range of wild, non-urban spaces. Projects must conserve, protect, enhance, restore, and/or reconnect habitats within a given landscape that are particularly important for the biodiversity there. This focus on biodiversity will also address the importance that EOCA places on the issue of climate change. Projects should ensure that the habitats being conserved are those that sequester carbon, reduce emissions, enable adaptations to climate change, and/or protect against further habitat and biodiversity loss. It is also very important that the projects are beneficial to the local communities that live in, or near, these habitats. Projects should highlight how they encourage local stewardship of habitats, alleviate poverty, support local ecosystem services, while at the same time, having a link to outdoor enthusiasts who value these precious wild spaces. Who can apply? Non profit organisations can apply to EOCA for grants of up to €30,000 to implement a conservation project of up to 24 months in duration in any country around the world except North America (US and Canada - where the Conservation Alliance provides funding for conservation efforts from the North American outdoor industry). Project applications are shortlisted according to their ability to meet EOCA's criteria for funding (see below). Using this criteria, the shortlist of projects is drawn up at the sole discretion of the General Managers, the Scientific Advisors and EOCA's Board of Directors. The General Managers will seek further advice from EOCA's Scientific Advisors if required. Due to the many diverse nationalities making up the whole panel, all applications must please be written in English. The projects to successfully win funding will be chosen from the shortlist via a public vote and/or an EOCA's members vote (in March for applications received in November and October for applications received in June). In Spring 2017, 60. 4 million people were reached through this process! The public vote involves some effort on the part of the projects involved, to mobilise supporters and generate votes for their project over a two week period. However, the process also gives projects a very valuable opportunity to raise the profile and awareness of their organisation and its work in an international arena. Members of EOCA can nominate up to three projects (from different, or the same organisations) each year. If you, as a conservation organisation, do not have any personal contacts to our members, please do not worry! Just apply directly! Project applications MUST: - protect a threatened species or habitat; - have a link to the outdoor enthusiast (see below); AND - involve hands-on practical conservation work. BEFORE STARTING YOUR APPLICATION, PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY. It will help you understand the types of nature conservation projects we are looking for and the information we need from you. Please also ensure to look at our frequently asked questions page. EOCA'S CRITERIA FOR FUNDING AND SCORING SYSTEM: Link to the outdoor enthusiast As EOCA is raising money from the European outdoor industry, we feel that conservation and restoration work should go hand-in-hand with responsible use of the 'wild' areas we all enjoy. Projects MUST therefore demonstrate a specific link to the outdoor enthusiast (such as hikers, bikers, kayakers, climbers, bird watchers or explorers etc). This is intended to be a positive, rather than limiting focus and may include enhancing the visitor's experience in an area as well as protecting an area from any detrimental impact caused by the visitor. It will make projects very relevant to those that are contributing towards their funding. As a small organisation, we hope that, not only will this give the projects we support a unique and specific focus, but will help other smaller organisations, which may not otherwise be considered for funding elsewhere, attract a grant from EOCA. The TWO MAIN areas that MUST be addressed in your application are: 1. Protect, enhance or restore threatened key species, habitats or broader ecosystems in 'wild' areas (10 points) EOCA defines 'wild' areas as non-urban environments and ecosystems occurring in as natural a state as possible, given the area's location and use. This may include for example moorland, hills, mountains, coasts, rivers, forest, grassland, peatland and ocean areas. 'Key' species, habitats or ecosystems are defined here as those which are threatened, those which play a 'keystone' function, or those which are indicators of broader ecosystem health*. The project must identify and address the key threats to the species, habitats or broader ecosystems, and how it will protect and /or enhance them. Innovative solutions to 'old' problems will be especially welcome! *Is the species an 'indicator' of wider habitat and ecosystem health? i. e. by recovering its populations, will it have a beneficial effect on other species and wildlife communities? Can the species be considered a 'keystone' species i. e. one that has a disproportionately large effect on its environment relative to its abundance, and may create conditions for other species to thrive? 2. Consider the needs of the outdoor enthusiast (10 points) As highlighted above, the project must enhance the experience of outdoor enthusiasts as well as protecting the identified species, habitat or broader ecosystem from any negative impact by their visits. Projects may, for example, enhance a visitor's experience by protecting a threatened species they might then see, or protect an area by ensuring trails / rock faces / waterways and /or associated information / education keeps visitors from damaging fragile habitats or disturbing vulnerable wildlife. Extra points will be given for innovative solutions to 'old' problems, particularly if they can be transferred to other geographical areas! At this stage, if the project being assessed receives less than 12 points, IT WILL NOT PROCEED any further in the application process. Related resources Project Funding Vote Report - March 2021. pdf Project Outcomes: Your application should include 3 easily identifiable and measurable outcomes to show how the project will address the issues above. They should consider: 1. Conservation measures addressing specific issues and root causes (5 points) What are the identified threats to the species / habitat / ecosystem? What are the impacts of these threats? How are these threats going to be eliminated, alleviated or better managed? How will the habitat / ecosystem be protected, enhanced or restored? How will the project deliver the desired outcomes? How will the experience for the local community, the visitors and the habitat be enhanced in the long term? Please note: projects MUST include practical on-the-ground conservation work, such as tree planting, removal of invasive species, anti poaching measures, habitat restoration etc. 2. Involvement / engagement of local people (5 points) In order for a project to be sustainable, it is vital that local people are fully engaged. If local communities and also communities of interest are not involved, they may not feel any need or desire to ensure that the good work that has been started continues into the future. Obviously, if specialist work needs to be carried out, relevant experts may need to be brought in, but wherever possible, projects will involve the local community, giving them ownership of the project and its outcomes, and contributing to their livelihoods during and after the project. Please note: EOCA will consider projects which provide social benefits as a result of conservation measures. HOWEVER, projects whose sole goal is to provide only social benefits will NOT be eligible; projects must be implementing conservation measures with a link to the outdoor enthusiast. 3. Education and communication (5 points) Education and communication should be aimed at both local communities and visitors. Education should include communicating responsible ways of enjoying the project area, suggestions as to how visitors and locals can reduce threats to the species, habitat or ecosystem, and ways in which they can help protect the biodiversity of the project area. How will you reach the potential visitors to the area effectively and communicate with the local community, and how will this process continue once EOCA's funding for the project has finished? Please note: EOCA will not consider projects that are based on 100% education. 4. How your project helps mitigate against climate change (5 points) This may include restoring, conserving and protecting habitats and ecosystems which store and/or capture carbon for example. Projects must also: Be measurable and time orientated (5 points) The work must demonstrate clear and measurable impacts over its duration (up to 24 months). What indicators can be measured to evidence impact? For example, if training is given, how will you measure it's success? If anti-poaching measures are used, how will you assess their effectiveness? Some examples of measureable and time orientated outcomes: 'number' trees to be planted by 'date'; 'number' meters of trail to be created/restored by 'date'; 'number' clean ups/removal of invasive species carried out over 'number' days and covering 'number' hectares and 'number' of 'locations'; 'number' workshops to be carried out by 'date'; at least 'number' volunteers/locals undertaking 'project goals' over 'number' days. Provide a legacy (5 points) The beneficial effects of the project should be sustained beyond the duration of the project. What processes will be set up to ensure the work that has been started will continue to be monitored and managed in the long term? How will the project benefit the livelihoods of the local people or the local economy both during and after the project? The types of project EOCA will NOT support (unless they are primarily hands on conservation based / linked with local biodiversity loss / education about conservation etc) are: Projects in urban areas 100% community or social projects 100% research / PhD's / MSC's / expeditions / conference attendance 100% education projects Building projects Installation of alternative energy Alternative / sustainable transport Waste management projects (unless linked to detrimental effect on local biodiveristy / education of recreational users of the area). This includes local community recycling / incinerating projects. Animal welfare and rehabiliation of captive animals EOCA will also NOT support projects: Which are party political or linked to religious groups Covering general overheads, maintenance costs or salary payments Seeking the acquisition of buildings Promoting violent or illegal action Involving lobbying governments / campaigning on environmental issues IF YOUR ORGANISATION HAS PREVIOUSLY APPLIED FOR FUNDING: In order that the process is fair to all those taking part and gives newcomers to the process equal opportunities to be successful, EOCA asks organisations to adhere to the following policy: If a project gains funding - The organisation can only apply for funding after the current project has completed, and the final report has been accepted by EOCA. If a project has been shortlisted twice and not gained funding either time - EOCA asks that the organisation does not reapply for another 2 funding rounds (1 year). If a project has applied on 3 occasions but never gained a position on the shortlist (even if the project has been amended following feedback from EOCA) - EOCA asks that the organisation does not reapply for funding for another 3 funding rounds (18 months). Finally, please be clear and concise when writing your application, with clearly stated aims, goals, methods and outcomes; we are a very small team with a lot of applications to read, and only so much time in which to do this.

If you have a particular preference for one of the four projects above, please state this in the cover letter. Please include the project title for reference and your contact details. The deadline for applications is Monday 11th April 2022 at 17:00 Irish time. Project Detail: (1) Development of approaches to enable demand response in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) Lead Supervisor: Dr Recep Kaan Dereli, Co-Supervisor: Dr Sarah Cotterill Context: This project explores the potential of demand-response, i. e. demand shedding and shifting, in the water industry. A realistic hydrologic and hydraulic model that is capable of modelling both hydrology of a catchment and hydraulic behavior of pipes will be developed to simulate run-off and sewer system flow. The model will utilize future precipitation and temperature estimations of climate and weather forecast models. The model predictions will be used to develop strategies for integrated operation of sewer network and WWTP to optimize both effluent quality and energy cost. (2) Decentralised Resource and Energy Efficiency: Source Separation Lead Supervisor: Dr Sarah Cotterill, Co-Supervisor: Dr Recep Kaan Dereli Context: This project explores the circular management and efficient use of water, waste, energy and resources at the commercial building scale. This includes investigating options for source separation to enable decentralised treatment and re-use of separated waste streams, such as urine and/or grey water. The PhD candidate will evaluate the techno-economic feasibility of source separation technologies and assess their impact on the circular management of resources. (3) Decentralised Resource and Energy Efficiency: Water Efficiency and Reuse Lead Supervisor: Dr Sarah Cotterill, Co-Supervisor: Dr Recep Kaan Dereli Context: This project explores whether reducing building water use provides an opportunity to reduce energy consumption. Buildings are the second largest consumers of energy after transport in Ireland and account for over a third of all CO2 emissions. The engineered water cycle is energy intensive at every stage. The PhD candidate will develop a holistic model extending from buildings (where the water is consumed and transformed to wastewater) to sewage treatment plants (located at the end of the pipe) to evaluate the use of water and energy, and better inform their management. (4) Innovative technologies with resource recovery and energy systems integration perspectives in wastewater treatment plants. Lead Supervisor: Prof. Eoin Casey, Co-Supervisor Dr Sarah Cotterill Context: This project involves the development of a system-wide model exploring the wastewater-energy nexus. WWTPs are typically large consumers of energy. As a result of more resource recovery and energy efficiency drivers, it is now possible to operate WWTPs with energy neutrality. This is due to the deployment of new processes and technologies including high rate activated sludge, aerobic granulation, membranes, improved aeration systems amongst others. The PhD candidate will conduct mass and energy balances, thermodynamic calculations and carbon footprint calculations to investigate the overall impact of these technologies on the greenhouse gas emissions of the wastewater treatment sector. All PhD projects are expected to begin in September 2022. "

"Outline This research aims to extend existing work which examines beginning undergraduate students' problem solving and procedural skills, in the context of the introduction of the 'Project Maths' curriculum in second level education in Ireland in 2008. One of the aims of 'Project Maths' was to change the emphasis of second level mathematics education from a focus on rote learning and procedural skills to real understanding and problem solving. Work carried out by Faulkner et al (2021) demonstrates that students problem solving skills on entry to third level education have not improved in the lifetime of the Project Maths roll out. This recent work therefore called for a qualitative investigation into what challenges students may be having, when they engage with both procedural skills in mathematics and problem-solving skills. This PhD aims to carry out such an investigation using a pre-approved diagnostic test (Faulkner et al 2021) along with a 'thinking-aloud' method of data collection. This method asks students to verbalise their thoughts while they work through an exam paper or set of tasks (Nielsen 2012). The research aims to continue to collect yearly quantitative data to keep a longitudinal record of students' performance in the diagnostic test. The project will include Examining existing trends in beginning third level students' mathematical performance with a particular focus on lower attaining students. Investigating students problem solving and procedural skills. Using qualitative methodologies to determine students challenges when engaging with mathematics. Build large databases of students' performance for statistical analysis. Implementing an intervention to support student mathematical learning. Determining how the findings compare/contrast to national and international research. Use the research findings to inform policy and practice in mathematics education and in turn to improve the provision of mathematics education for beginning undergraduates. What is funded Student Stipend: €18,500 per year for 4 years €2,000 per year budget for travel and materials included Fees: €4,500 per year paid by the project. Duration 4 Year Eligibility Student requirements for this project Ideally, the candidate will have some experience teaching mathematics at second level and have a sound grasp of basic mathematical principles at that level.

Candidate will work in the frame research project funded by the National Science Center, Republic of Poland (project no. OPUS 2019/33/B/ST10/01232) and awarded to professor Piotr Kowalczuk. The research project in the framework of OPUS program is entitled ""Estimation of diffusion coefficient of dissolved organic matter from sediments to overlying waters through relationships between its optical and chromatographic characteristics and dissolved iron in Baltic Sea deeps"". This project will be conducted with collaboration with National Institute of Aquatic Resources, Technical University of Denmark, Kemitorvet, 2800 Kgs. Lyngby , Denmark. PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The main goal of the project is to determine diffusion coefficient of identified DOM fraction from sediments pore waters into near bottom water, and to relate its magnitude to oceanographic conditions: (salinity, dissolved oxygen concentration, DO, pH and sediment type). The working hypothesis of this project is that, the DOM optical properties are correlated with dissolved iron concentration in sediments pore waters and overlying waters. Project goal will be achieved through qualitative and quantitative characterization of the dissolved organic matter - DOM in the Baltic Sea deep's bottom sediments pore waters and overlaying near bottom water and water column in different oceanographic conditions with use of absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy and High Performance Size-Exclusion Chromatography and established correlation between optical characteristics of DOM and concentration of dissolved iron and dissolved organic carbon. Spectroscopic analysis will include measurements of light absorption by chromophoric dissolved organic matter - CDOM, and measurements of DOM fluorescence excitation emission matrix spectra - EEMs. Chromatographic analysis will enable separation of different molecular weight fractions of DOM, and after fractionation spectroscopic analysis will be applied to characterize material grouped into molecular weight classes. Data achieved from spectroscopic, chromatographic and environmental and laboratory measurements will be analyzed statistically, to identify which molecular weight and qualitative DOM fractions were most susceptible to migrate and in which direction across sediments/near bottom water interface. Comparison of DOM composition, based on optical and chromatographic signatures, in collected samples will enable understanding of DOM transformation processes during its early diagenesis. This project will be executed through the field and laboratory work campaigns undertaken by team of experienced researchers during research cruises on board of r/v Oceania to Bornholm Deep, Gdansk Deep and Gotland Deep in the Baltic Sea. Research tasks at the post-doc position: limited participation in field work, collection and preservation of samples, laboratory analysis: and spectroscopic absorption and fluorescence measurements of dissolved organic matter, data analysis, statistical analysis and modeling - development of PARAFAC model for fluorescence data, PCA model for spectroscopic, chromatographic, chemical, and environmental data construction of water mass balance model to assess optical properties of DOM in Baltic Sea Deeps participation in external consultations with foreign cooperating researchers and institutions, preparation of figures, tables, and writing manuscripts of scientific papers, presentation of results at conferences, participation in project promotion and dissemination.

"Outline In the manufacture of high-value chemical products, such as pharmaceuticals, separation and purification from complex, multicomponent mixtures are crucial steps. Crystallisation, often accompanied by other separations steps (extraction, distillation) is nearly always deployed, due to its separation effectiveness and extreme flexibility. These possibilities provide a multitude of choices for selecting the optimal design solution, in terms of product quality and process efficiency, as well as waste production, material and energy consumption. However, the optimal process design requires accurate and reliable thermodynamic data for multicomponent mixtures in the system over a wide range conditions (e. g. , solvents, impurity concentrations, temperatures, pressures) which are often missing, especially for new compounds. These data can be obtained by performing a multitude of measurements across a broad range of conditions; however, this is time consuming, expensive and requires significant quantities of material which may not be available (e. g. , in the early stages of drug discovery). Thermodynamic models can be used to estimate these data; however, they have limited accuracy and reliability, especially for compounds and process conditions not previously encountered. In principle, some of these models can be successively improved by incorporating additional experimental measurements. Each measurement has an information value, but it also has an associated cost related to the energy, effort, time, and materials required to perform the measurement. Certain measurements are likely to be more valuable, resulting in more reliable thermodynamic predictions. However, it is not clear what sequence of which experiments would yield most valuable thermodynamic information. The ability to balance this trade-off and follow an optimal sequence of experiments would be transformative for our ability to rationally design efficient industrial separation processes. The aim of the proposed work is to develop an intelligent decision system, implemented as a software application tool, that will specify the precise sequence of experiments that will most efficiently provide the information to produce an accurate thermodynamic model of pharmaceutical compounds in complex, multicomponent mixtures. The intelligent decision system will be adaptable, so users can define what is meant by optimal: minimizing economic cost, time, complexity/availability of experimental technique(s) or required amount of materials. The proposed work will use machine learning to develop an automated methodology to efficiently construct accurate mathematical representations of the thermodynamics of complex multicomponent mixtures. This will provide engineers and scientists a novel intelligent decision system to determine the optimal experimental measurements that will most effectively improve the thermodynamic model and yield most accurate predictions. It will radically improve our ability to rapidly and efficiently construct accurate thermodynamic models, which is key to the development of any chemical manufacturing process. Although the proposed project is focused on pharmaceutical separation processes, it will have direct relevance to other industries, such as fine chemicals production, biorefining and bioprocessing. It has a strong potential to be transformative in enabling rational design of efficient separation processes across these industries and we will make it widely accessible to the user community through a user friendly app based interface.

"Outline Nucleation of crystals from solution is a crucial part of many manufacturing processes, in global sectors including pharmaceuticals, medicine, foods, chemicals and advanced materials. Nevertheless, despite many years of detailed study, nucleation remains poorly understood at the fundamental as well as the practical application level. This project, co-funded by industrial partners GSK, aims at furthering our understanding of the key role so-called secondary nucleation plays in pharmaceutical manufacturing process design. Secondary nucleation is where new nuclei are triggered and controlled by the addition of pre-existing nuclei to a manufacturing process. This project aims at furthering our understanding of how secondary nucleation works and can be optimised at scales relevant to industrial manufacture. There are two major physical aspects of the process that become important under manufacturing conditions but whose effects are not well understood: firstly, the impact on nucleation and growth of the turbulent shear flow typical in industrial reactors; and secondly the effect of mechanical impact between existing seed (and secondary-nucleated) crystals in the typical manufacturing feedstock consisting of a slurry of seed crystals. The project will contribute both fundamental insight into material behaviour and phenomenology, and progress in advanced industrial manufacturing methods. In addition to undertaking cutting edge research, students are also registered for the Postgraduate Certificate in Researcher Development (PGCert), which is a supplementary qualification that develops a student's skills, networks and career prospects.

"Outline Biomass is increasingly important as a source of renewable energy and in chemical synthesis. Biomass includes agricultural and forestry waste: maximising the utilisation of these resources contributes significantly to reducing fossil-fuel dependence and combating climate change. Biomass undergoes thermal processing, either by direct combustion to generate energy, or to produce sustainable fuels or chemical feedstocks. Potassium is naturally present in agricultural biomass residues. Inherent potassium in biomass has a substantial catalytic influence on its thermal decomposition, and thus affects the yield of bio-products and the overall energy efficiency from the advanced thermal treatment of biomass, e. g. , pyrolysis and gasification. During thermal processing, potassium is released and forms various compounds such as KCl and KOH, which can be harmful to processing equipment. A step-change in imaging and sensing techniques would allow better understanding of biomass thermal processes associated with the synergetic impact of potassium, thus ultimately facilitating improved design of industrial processes. The aim of this PhD project is to develop a laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) instrument for quantitative imaging of total potassium content in thermal processes. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy involves the use of a tightly focussed, pulsed laser beam to create a plasma in which the compounds in the flow are decomposed. The resulting spectral emission can therefore be related to the total elemental concentration. The proposed methods totally avoid the use of extractive sampling, which is intrusive to the flow, and use only techniques capable of spatially-resolved optical imaging. The application of these methods will be tested first in flames seeded with potassium before moving to biomass combustion and gasification processes of increasing practical relevance. The student working on the proposed project will receive extensive training on both the principles and application of optical measurements in combustion, as well as the fundamentals of thermal energy processes and biomass processing. There will also be ongoing engagement with a wider network of collaborating researchers. Participation in national and international conferences will be encouraged with examples being ""Laser Diagnostics in Combustion and Energy Science"" and ""International Symposium on Combustion"".

"Flexit was set up in 2009 and seeks new, flexible solutions to spread research and researchers outside higher education institutions (HEIs). The main purpose is to: 1) build bridges between humanities and social sciences (HSS) research and companies and organisations outside academia and 2) facilitate knowledge exchange and encourage contacts so that more non-academic organisations can perceive and profit from the expertise of postdoctoral HSS specialists and 3) to highlight alternative career opportunities for HSS researchers. The main purpose of the project is to strengthen the ties between Humanities and Social Sciences research and the private sector, which is commonly regarded as the weakest link in the 'knowledge triangle'. In the long term, RJ seeks to influence the academic merit system so that academia values experience from the business world more highly, and vice versa. Experience to date has been very good, both for the host establishments and for the researchers. In the new version of Flexit, the hope is to enhance academic institutions' involvement in the programme and bridge-building. After an evaluation of the Flexit pilot project, RJ has opened the programme to senior researchers as well and organised the positions so that the researcher is employed at the host establishment (company or organisation) for two years, followed by a year at an HEI. Accordingly, applicants must have established affiliations to their departments by the time of application. The companies and organisations taking part in this Flexit call are Bräcke diakoni, Welfare Department, City Office, City of Malmö, Culture Administration, City of Gothenburg, Norrbottens Kommuner, R&D&I, Education Administration, Piteå Municipality and Spotify. In 2017, there are i. e. six in-house research positions at companies or organisations ('host establishments') in Sweden available through Flexit. "

"The Smart specialisation scholarships scheme for PhD students has a programme budget of €3 million. It will be implemented over the period 2016 - 2022, although in the first academic year, due to delays and difficulties in developing guidelines, it was not possible to launch the scheme, which will instead be implemented from 2017. Under the scheme, €422 per month (equal to the doctoral grant paid by the government) is paid to PhD students of Estonian universities who conduct research related to the smart specialisation growth areas. The smart specialisation scholarships are paid to the PhD students of Estonian universities who conduct a research related to the smart specialisation growth areas. The objectives are to: support cooperation between R&D institutions and companies, to diversify the career prospects of PhD graduates and to contribute to capacity-building in research-intensive industry sectors. Preference is given to applicants conducting their doctoral research that is responsive to industry needs, addressing the practical problems of specific sector/company or contribute directly to implementation of research findings in everyday industry practice (industrial PhD). Among the differences between the ERDF-funded Smart Specialisation scheme and the ESF-funded DoRa are the focus on Smart Specialisation sectors which is new in the 2014-2020 period and the fact that there are comparatively major budget constraints. Consequently, there is no extra dedicated funding to fund teaching activities relating to the ISM element and funding must ccome from the overall teaching budget. However, Universities have earmarked scome research funding to promote cooperation with businesses, and to develop practical applied research projects with industry and this scheme could be a useful mechanism for achieving this. A mid-term evaluation of the new Smart specialisation scholarships scheme programme's implementation is envisaged for 2018. "

"Outline Are you an ICT graduate in computer science or cognate discipline looking to pursue a PhD? Do you want to make a real contribution in the area of customised networks and specifically trustworthiness for OPEN RAN? Do you want to undertake your studies as part of the world leading SFI CONNECT Research Centre? The Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) Centre for Future Networks and Communications in partnership with Munster Technological University (MTU) and University College Dublin (UCD) is seeking to recruit a PhD student to contribute to the area of customised networks and specifically trustworthiness for OPEN RAN. The student will be a member of the SFI CONNECT Research Centre and will be based in MTU, jointly supervised by Dr. Susan Rea (MTU), Dr. Bernd Ludwig Wenning (MTU), Dr. Nima Afraz (UCD) and Dr. Fatemeh Golpayegani (UCD). An overview of the post is presented below: As network virtualisation technology matures, it enables operators to experiment with very flexible network architectures, including Cloud-RAN and has introduced the possibility for more split options across the RAN. This has allowed network operators to place RAN virtualised components across geographical and computational spaces, from the Core to the Edge and the Radio units enabling customized architectures to achieve higher cost efficiencies and meet application specific stringent 5G performance requirements such a latency, jitter, and scalability. Network operators along with vendors and standardisation authorities including 3GPP, O-RAN Alliance, IEEE and others have identified the lack of built-in interoperability in current virtualised networks and have looked towards Open-RAN to address the need for interoperability between the virtual components that are to be provided by a plethora of vendors through standardised open network interfaces. This project will focus on a 'Post Open-RAN' ecosystem where the traditional RAN market ecosystem with a handful of known major vendor-operators will be replaced by a substantially more diverse ecosystem made up of unconventional vendors, new operators and resource providers. This will mean that the traditional known and trust relationships between established market actors will be inadequate and will require a rethinking of the definition of trust and the approaches to re-establish trust in these environments. This PhD project will consider trusted collaboration in Open-RAN from the perspective of the trust relationships between vendors to operators as a means of guaranteeing trusted interoperability and between vendors & resource (cloud-edge infrastructure) providers to enable participation in trusted orchestration. The PhD student will be expected to contribute to CONNECT's Education and Public Engagement (EPE) activities to promote awareness and engagement of the public with science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) research. The successful candidate will be expected to carry out a minimum of 2 engagement activities per year and engage with the EPE activities for the Centre. For example, this can include participating in public events to promote research, writing media articles or contributing to educational activities. What is funded This is a 4-year fully funded (includes full fees and an annual stipend of €18,500) structured PhD position with an expected start date of September 2022. Duration 4 years.

"Outline Requirements: - PhD diploma - great enthusiasm for work and science in general - track record of scientific publications - experience in laboratory work - ability to carry out statistical large-scale analyses - very good knowledge of English both oral and writing Task description: Brief description of the project: The Arctic is warming twice as fast as other parts of the world, causing the ice sheet to disappear rapidly. The region is considered to be one of the fastest changing systems on Earth. The disappearance of sea ice due to global warming leads to higher pCO2 values ​​in the surface waters of the Arctic Ocean, decreased calcium carbonate (CaCO3) saturation as well as increased biological production. These changes have and will have a profound impact on the carbon cycle not only in the Arctic Ocean but also globally. These changes will affect the balance of carbon sequestration and release from the seas and oceans. The proposed project will use this model system for the project focusing on a comprehensive assessment of the impact of changes on ecosystems. In addition to many investigations related to the physicochemical elements of the environment, such as factors controlling the chemistry of water masses and the broadly speaking environmental background, the project will also study the factors controlling mineralogy and the chemistry of marine organisms carbonate skeletons. The proposed project aims to solve the global problem of the influence of increased CO2 concentration in the ocean and the associated fluctuations of carbonate ions on the biodiversity of marine invertebrates. The study will take place in contrasting environments characterized by variable physicochemical parameters, e. g. changing CaCO3 saturation, different strength of sea currents, salinity, temperature. The project will generate wide range of unique data. Especially designed sampling protocol in environments with naturally occurring variations in carbonates saturation levels and environmental factors in general (e. g. polar night versus polar day, seaweed forest versus non-seaweed regions, depth gradient) will allow to perform many analyzes including: chemical and mineralogical variability of skeletons carbonate, the level of biological control of the skeletal structures of Arctic organisms, the role of kelp forest in shaping the physicochemical or biological environment, variability of conditions within the contrasting polar seasons and their impact on selected elements of the living part of environment. The project is looking for an enthusiastic and creative scientist who will explore the data generated by the project or will generate data herself/himself based on the project's possibilities, creating unique knowledge. The project will be willing to adapt to the vision of a good candidate. Description of tasks required from the candidate during the project: additionally, to the above formal requirements, the candidate is expected to be involved in field work, have knowledge about marine systems, laboratory work leading to the preparation of biological material for various purposes, potentially geochemical analyzes, knowledge of data analysis and visualization techniques, knowledge of the R and Python programming environment is welcomed, the ability to analyse data related to biodiversity, the ability to work independently, as well as the ability to work in a team, high creativity and critical thinking skills, communication and interpersonal skills.

"Keywords green chemistry, natural solvents, marine molecules, bacteriology, dysbiosis Profile and skills required The candidate must have a Master 2 in the chemistry/biology interface, with good theoretical and practical skills in organic synthesis. Additional skills in the field of bacteriology, as well as cell biology would be appreciated. We are looking for a rigorous, autonomous, versatile candidate, with a capacity for teamwork and skills for written and oral communication in French and English. Project description Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory disease with a high prevalence in industrialized countries. This disease is the consequence of a dysfunction of the skin barrier associated with an imbalance of the skin microbiota, which results in over-colonization by Staphylococcus aureus in more than 70% of cases. This over-colonization, especially by resistant strains to methicilin (MRSA) constitutes an aggravating factor of the pathology because it leads to an increase in the pro-inflammatory reaction. To date, there is no effective treatment for this skin dysbiosis, which is, however, an aggravating factor of the disease. In our laboratory (EA SIMBA 7502), we have developed access routes to natural molecules of marine origin which have demonstrated bactericidal (or static depending on) activity against sensitive and resistant strains of S. aureus. These access routes, although efficient, have a negative environmental impact, particularly linked to the use of petrochemical solvents and heavy metal catalysts. Since 2018, the SIMBA laboratory has specialized in the development of new green solvents: NaDES. These NaDES represent an eco-friendly alternative to petrochemical solvents but also to certain catalysts used in the laboratory. Some NaDES from the laboratory library have also demonstrated interesting effects on the growth of several microorganisms representative of the skin microbiota involved in the pathophysiology of AD. Thus, the synergy between the two therapeutic strategies developed in the laboratory appeared to be relevant. This thesis would thus have for objectives to access analogues of these natural antibiotic molecules by an approach of ""green chemistry"", then to associate them with various NaDES in order to create a synergy aiming at restoring the balance of the cutaneous microbiota for the treatment of AD References [1] S.

"Keywords Proteases, Glycosaminoglycanes, collagen, Inhibitors Profile and skills required Profile: Master 2 (Biology-Health-Biochemistry-Structural biology) Strong knowledge in biochemistry-enzymology-cell culture. Skills in chromatography and/or electrophoresis technics-Fluorescent spectroscopy background would be an advantage. Autonomy, rigorous, good team spirit. Project description Osteoporosis is a metabolic bone disease in which the density and quality of bone are reduced, thus leading to an increased risk of fracture. Human cysteine Cat K is the major bone-degrading protease and has, among others, a potent collagenase activity towards type I and II collagens, the two major organic components of the bone matrix. This important role in the process of bone resorption makes Cat K a very attractive target for the therapeutic treatment of osteoporosis. Within the last decade, particular attention has been paid to the development of potent and selective active-site directed Cat K inhibitors as anti-resorptive drugs. However, all the compounds developed so far completely block the different enzyme activities of Cat K in bone and beyond (lung, heart, and brain) leading to unwanted side effects (i. e. stroke, lung fibrosis). Thus, new pharmacochemical approaches are needed to design novel inhibitors of Cat K to modulate only its excessive collagenase activity without impairing its other physiological regulatory proteolytic activities. Interestingly, studies strongly suggest that the collagenase activity of human Cat K is specifically dependent on the formation of a multimeric complex between Cat K and linear chondroitin 4 sulfate (C4S) through interactions between sulfates groups and several identified positively charged residues on the surface of Cat K located away from the active site (exosites). This project is based on the hypothesis that any disruption in the formation of the complex between Cat K and high molecular weight C4S by biomimetic oligosaccharides would selectively inhibit the collagenase activity of Cat K and thus could be a valuable therapeutic option in the treatment of collagen-degradation-related diseases, including osteoporosis.

"Brief description of our research group: Our research group is focused on the development and application of advanced spectroscopic tools for the design of active catalysts for water oxidation, proton reduction, and methane to methanol production processes. Currently the development of artificial photosynthetic assemblies and biological mimics of naturally methane oxidizing enzymes is of great interest and has drawn significant attention by exploring molecular catalysts based on 3d transition metal complexes. However, in spite of emerging design principles, there is an urgent need to correlate the performance and stability of a catalyst to its geometric structure and electronic configuration for its rational development. In this regard, we are interested in the development of static and time-resolved X-ray based spectroscopic approaches, including X-ray absorption (XAS) and X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES), to understand the critical electronic, energetic and geometric requirements of the water splitting and methane oxidation reactions necessary for achieving economically feasible catalysts. Our research is particularly oriented towards ultrafast pump (laser), X-ray (probe) studies of metal noble-free photosensitizers, and multimolecular photocatalytic systems for artificial photosynthesis in the femtosecond-microsecond time regime. Combined analysis of experimental data on structures, electronic configurations and spin states provide valuable information to understand the operation mechanism. Further selectivity is achieved through resonant XES or resonant inelastic X-ray scattering spectroscopy. Synchrotron-based techniques employed in our group are complemented with laboratory-based spectroscopic methods such as UV-Visible spectroscopy, Resonance Raman, Electron Paramagnetic Resonance, Optical transient absorption spectroscopy, and Atomic Force Microscopy. Our studies involve the interplay of several disciplines including synthetic inorganic chemistry, electrochemistry, kinetics, and spectroscopy. Ph. D project funded over 3 years: The project will consist in studying solar fuel catalysts through static and ultrafast in-situ X-ray spectroscopy and electrochemistry. The main objectives of the project will be to probe the electronic and structural changes occuring near the active catalytic site through X-ray absorption, emission and resonant inelastic scattering spectroscopy. The student will also be trained in Raman, Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelecron spectroscopy. The Ph. D student will assist in writing the beamtime proposals, and carrying out the synchrotron and laboratory-based experiments, data analysis and interpretation. Required Qualifications: M. S in chemistry, Physics or Biological Science Experience in synthesis Strong analytical skills, written and verbal communication skills Candidates are required to submit a complete an updated CV with a brief description of the previous research and a motivation letter. Applications should be sent to the email dooshaye. moonshiram@csic. es before April 1st 2022. "

"PhD or Dr. med. in Human Brain Mapping Project description: Aim of the project is the cytoarchitectonic analysis and mapping of the human hypothalamus in histological sections, and the development of 3D maps of hypothalamic nuclei as a tool to evaluate structure-function relationships. The hypothalamus is part of the diencephalon that is involved in a variety of functions including the maintenance of the homeostasis, metabolism, stress, the circadian rhythm or sleep. The hypothalamus links the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland. The function of the hypothalamus can be studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging, but it is difficult or even impossible to localize activations in the functionally different nuclei. Currently, there are no maps, which inform neuroimaging studies about the microstructural segregation of the hypothalamus in 3D space, while considering variations in individual brain anatomy. This is where the planned doctoral thesis comes in. The project includes the analysis of serial, histological sections stained for cell bodies of ten postmortem brains. Microscopical image analysis and deep learning, in combination with statistical tools of analysis and visualization will be applied to obtain maps of the hypothalamus, which will be brought into a standard 3D space for comparison with functional imaging data. Cytoarchitectonic probability maps will be computed that reflect intersubject variability. One of the brains is the BigBrain, an anatomical model of a human brain, reconstructed at 20 mm isotropic, which allows to develop an ultrahigh-resolution reconstructions of hypothalamic nuclei. All maps will be made available to the scientific community, and are part of the Julich-Brain atlas and the multimodal atlas of the EBRAINS platform developed by the Human Brain Project. There is flexibility to shape the project according to the expertise and interests of the applicant. It is expected that results of the study will be published in high-impact scientific journals. The work takes place in an interdisciplinary team and offers possibilities to present results at internal, national and international meetings.

"Outline Buildings account for about one third of greenhouse gas emissions globally: exacerbated by poor maintenance, building systems inefficiencies and other human activities. Additionally, poorly maintained buildings become increasingly vulnerable to damage caused by the increasing severity of climate change hence becoming even more inefficient in managing energy, waste and quality of overall building. Poorly maintained buildings also pose safety risks to residents (e. g. fire). Multi-occupancy adds further complexity on decision making about occupant comfort and activities. This PhD project is supervised by staff from Schools of Computer Science, Architecture, Engineering and Psychology would focus on the 3-way interaction between humans, the embedded systems in a building (e. g. IoT), and their digital twins (BIM), where, challenges remain to ensure this interaction is reliable (secure and private), efficient (enabling strong linkage between data), interactive (informative and responsive) and effective. Challenges that are magnified in the context of less developed countries while corresponding opportunities for enhancement are great. Your work would pursue one of the following multi-disciplinary aims: (1) design secure and trustworthy data flows (qualitative and quantitative) between these three systems, (2) deliver effective stakeholder interaction (occupants, owners, managers, government, industry, emergency services and general public) enabling understanding of HCI's application in the built environment and, (3) design and develop interaction between data flows, digital twins and stakeholders to reduce carbon footprints, enhance health and wellbeing and increase building safety. For instance, the project will deliver interactive tools to access and to update records of building maintenance (and the quality of maintenance) and safety risk assessments- MOT equivalent for buildings- for relevant stakeholders in a secure manner, to inform families on how their individual or overall family lifestyle and activities contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and to help them to make informed decisions on how to reduce emissions while looking after their health, comfort and safety, or to inform emergency services on significant hazards and risks during firefighting in buildings e. g. construction and design, use of the building and so on. This project will address the one or more of following research questions (but not limited to): • What is the best way to monitor a building lifecycle while capturing users' activities and experiences? • What is the best way to monitor occupants' safety risk factors in a building? • How to accurately and securely collect, store, access and modify (building and occupants) data? • Which interactions between humans, embedded systems and the digital twins are more effective in making positive change in human behaviour, decision making and knowledge sharing for stakeholders and buildings in reducing carbon footprints, climate change adaptation and occupants' wellbeing, health & safety?

"Outline Beyond the initial benefit to the general idea of 'immersion', the 'uses' of audio within AR technology are many and varied. There are Cognitive, User Experience and User Interface benefits to utilising audio more deeply in AR. Including audio in moving cues (e. g. skill based or shooting games) can reduce reaction time up to 50% (Barde, Ward, Helton & Billinghurst (2016)). Localising targets that emit sounds as users travel through space in games - whether it's a whirring engine, a shuffling footstep or smooth servo sound adds to immersive experience; audio cues help users to understand the world around them before they have the time to turn their head in the direction the sound is coming from. For highly immersive spatial audio, these spectral cues can be mimicked by calibrating headphones to head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). Since we all have different-sized heads and torsos, delivering audio through head-tracking headphones, calibrated to our unique, custom-measured HRTFs, is the challenge timely for AR and VR technologies. One approach for customised HRTF for an individual AR headset-wearer would be HRTF data is captured by placing microphones inside user's ears, and recording data on how sound waves hit the body as audio is played in a 360-degree manner around the user. This process is too onerous to do at scale, ""generalist"" HRTFs are encoded into the algorithms of many spatial audio technologies. (The generalist HRTF data comes from publicly available data sets, obtained from a generalist set of people's heads and torsos. ) However, emerging AR technologies are equipped with sensors designed to begin a custom ""HRTF anatomy calibration"" process. This proposal aims to investigate the ability to acoustically conform the sound in the Experience to the environment that the device is placing it in. All AR technologies (handheld and head-worn) currently available have restrictions on the field of view that they have with their ability to be aware of the room that the device is in. Whether this is through inside-out tracking or stereo cameras capable of depth perception. Mobile AR is able to detect surfaces and allow movement around AR objects with the double-camera array that is included on iPhone X and AR-ready iPads (2017). Hololens, Meta and other AR headsets are able to detect the extent and depth of a room. Lower end mobile devices with only one camera are still able to detect surfaces, but do not have the same level of depth detection. This work will investigate the efficiency and efficacy of some capture or calibration of the space to use this data for advanced acoustical rendering (similar to how a user must calibrate a VR setup to ensure the external cameras 'know' where the headset is in space). This type of calibration can be either stored on a mobile device to be used for processing or a real-time geometry-based rendering algorithm can be executed on non-tethered devices. Currently, physical rendering is only possible with a small number of software spatialisers (such as SteamAudio and NVIDIA).

"Outline Research shows that there has been an increase in number of pedestrians, especially young people, getting injured while using mobile phones on-the-go. This finding is proportional to the increase in number of drivers getting injured while using mobile devices on-the-wheel. This has led to a number of studies examining cognitive resources (attention, memory) as well as physiological changes (gait posture, speed) and the effects of using a mobile device (texting, talking) while walking. Although laboratory-based studies have demonstrated that young adults are relatively resilient to dual-task interference during walking, emerging research suggests that the safety of young adults may be compromised during distracted walking in the real world, especially when walking while texting or talking on a smartphone. It is presently not known how young adults prioritise their attention during texting and walking. To accurately interpret dual-task interference it is imperative to measure single and dual-task performance in both tasks. PhD candidate(s) will use eye-trackers and built-in sensors on smartphones to track how people change their navigation strategies when using phones. PhD candidate(s) should demonstrate strong coding skills in Android, python, interest in eye-tracking, machine learning, data analysis and statistics.

"Outline Static and dynamic data sculptures have proven to be effective in self-reflection, awareness, engagement and hedonic aspects of behaviour change in the context of physical activity with adults and youths. This project builds on the existing work in the School and the literature on youths' awareness of physical activity and expands the work to youths' and adults' awareness of privacy online, gambling and climate change in households. The methodology will be based on agile development methodology and iterative design thinking process. These will allow the project to enhance understanding of issues from stakeholders' point of view, to identify solution(s) to address these societal challenges with stakeholders, to ideate with stakeholders, to create low- and mid- fidelity prototypes, to test with users and to repeat this process until satisfactory solution(s) are achieved. Core to the project, the PhD candidate will be to develop multi-modal solutions on ubiquitous computers (e. g. smartphones, Arduino, Pi, Teensy, TouchBoard), allowing users to identify potentially privacy-threatening scenarios, exposure to gambling Online or fake news about climate change Online. The multi-modal solution(s) as visual, audio, haptic or, smell will provide an overview of the threat severity. An agile development methodology will be used that incorporates parallel 'dual tracks' to support co-design alongside development. This will be completed through via scoping multi-modal design solutions and evaluation methods ""in the wild"" based on which form user requirements into increasing fidelity designs; low - prototyping with Play-Doh, sketching and/or drawings; medium fidelity with wireframes and mock-ups with ubiquitous computers and to initial high-fidelity design on smartphones, desktops, tablets or ubiquitous computers, which will be revised through an iterative co-design. Finally, processes and software for data set capture and open-sourcing will be specified and engineered (complying with RCUK data policies and ethical approval). The developed approach will be evaluated with stakeholders through tailored evaluation methods. The PhD candidate will tailor ubiquitous evaluation methods to support evaluation of key aspects of usability and multi-modal enhancement. The candidate will use an appropriate mix of qualitative and quantitative methods inspired by our multidisciplinary team to triangulate findings. The conclusion of this project will be one usable and fully functional open-source software product to represent one of the issues identified above on a ubiquitous platform for either youths or adults (or both). A pilot study will be required to test and validate. What is funded Self-Funded Students Only.

"Outline Dr Yi-Lin Wu is looking for a PhD student to work on the research project ""Enhancing organic room-temperature phosphorescence through supramolecular approaches. "" The project involves the design and synthesis of triplet-forming organic chromophores and the investigation of their photophysical properties induced by supramolecular interactions. Driven by the ever-increasing demands for sustainable chemistry and the interests in solar energy conversion, the Wu group is particularly interested in visible light-absorbing materials that have long excited-state lifetimes. Their ability to store photo-energies over hundreds of microseconds will enable a variety of chemical and optoelectronic applications, such as pollutant degradation, photocatalytic reactions, chemical sensing, bio-imaging, and electronic display. The photoinduced, long-lived species can be produced through the formation of charge-separated radical ions and/or triplet spin states. In either case, the excited molecules may relax radiatively to give phosphorescent emission, the radiative transition between states of different electronic spin multiplicities. This process occurs when the photo-excited molecules feature rapid spin-state interconversion and slow thermal deactivation, and is highly sensitive to the environment effects. Development of metal-free organic phosphors will expand the toolbox of phosphorescence materials that were traditionally dominated by inorganic chromophores containing heavy and scares elements. Since the photoexcited chromophores are surrounded by other molecules in the condensed phase, it is imperative to understand how the intermolecular interactions influence the excited-state structure and dynamics. We will take simultaneously the synthetic, spectroscopic, and computational approaches to precisely control the orientation and 3-D environment of the light-absorbed molecule. Through this study, we will determine structural and electronic factors that can enhance the phosphorescence efficiency. Such detailed understanding at the molecular level will facilitate the design of mechanically stable yet flexible electronic devices. The project is of experimental nature and will involve multi-step organic synthesis, spectroscopic characterization, and theoretical/computational chemistry. Through hands-on working with researchers specialized in EPR, laser and X-ray spectroscopies, the student will also develop the necessary knowledge and skills for efficient collaboration and communication.

"Outline Catalysis underpins our modern society: around 90% of all chemical processes use catalysts and the economic impact is estimated at a minimum of 30-40% global GDP. In particular, catalysis is integral to transitioning society away from fossil fuel towards greener energy sources; however, fossil fuel continues to dominate in industrial and transportation sectors because there are few commercially viable alternatives. To overcome this challenge, catalytic processes for green chemistry must be developed and understood, opening pathways for informed, improved catalyst design. Understanding catalytic function requires atomic-level insight, and thus catalyst design relies on predictions from computational simulations in order to guide the experimental investigations. These investigations can take the form of large-scale scans of potential catalytic materials, intelligent machine-learning approaches, or focused investigations of specific surface structures and/or reaction conditions; the knowledge can be coupled with experiment to then realise high selectivity and/or productivity from a particular catalytic reaction. Whilst significant progress has been made in recent years, across many fields, catalyst understanding continues to need refinement, and our novel computing approaches allow higher accuracy information to be delivered. Proposal: This project aims to propel catalyst design forward through development and application of advanced modelling techniques towards heterogeneous catalysis. The catalytic chemistry focuses on the capture, storage and release of CO2, which is necessary in order to mitigate current environmental challenges. Catalysts composed of earth abundant transition metal oxides (TMOs) will be designed, testing composition, defects, and surface structure, in order to understand how their potential towards reaction chemistry can be maximised. [1-3] The investigations will be pursued using state-of-the-art modelling techniques and incorporate machine-learning approaches in order to accelerate catalyst discovery. [4,5] The knowledge and predictions from the project be validated by experimental collaborators, and the outcomes used to design optimal conditions for synthesis and application of novel catalytic materials. Research Environment and Training: The student will be integrated into the group of Dr. Logsdail (https://logsdail. github. io) in the Cardiff Catalysis Institute (CCI). The student will be trained in catalysis and in high-performance computing (HPC). Training will be supported by extensive interaction with group members and colleagues, and will use state-of-the-art institutional (Hawk, Isambard) and national (ARCHER/ARCHER2) HPC computing facilities to perform simulations. As part of the broader CCI community, the student will have exposure to international leading figures in catalytic chemistry; Additionally, the student will participate in activities associated with the Cardiff University ""Materials Research Network"", which spans multiple schools within the University, and activities of the EPSRC-funded UK Catalysis Hub, of which the School of Chemistry is a key participant.

"Outline Dr Ben Ward http://www. cardiff. ac. uk/people/view/38527-ward-benjamin is looking for a PhD student to work on the research project 'Asymmetric catalysis using environmentally benign calcium complexes'. Research in the Ward group is concerned with the catalytic applications of main group and early transition metal organometallic and coordination complexes. The group has a particular interest in the development of new chiral catalysts based upon the alkaline earth, lanthanide, and early transition metals. Our research involves a significant amount of organic and inorganic syntheses, catalyst testing and optimisation, and mechanistic determination using state-of-the-art spectroscopic techniques and computational modelling methods. The research specifically concentrates on the Alkaline Earth metals (magnesium, calcium and strontium) and the lanthanide metals. •Preparation of new ligand environments for S-block and early transition metals •Development of asymmetric catalytic reactions using alkaline earth and lanthanide metals •Analysis of the coordination chemistry of alkaline earth and lanthanide metals when supported by chiral ligand environments •Reaction mechanism determination using spectroscopic analysis of catalytic intermediates One of our recent highlights has been the development of chiral calcium complexes for the asymmetric hydroamination of amino-olefins. [1,2] In our latest publications, we reported the highest enantioselectivity for this reaction when using calcium as an environmentally friendly and inexpensive alternative to precious metal catalysts. [1] One of the major challenges associated with the coordination complexes of calcium is their propensity to undergo ligands redistribution, or ""Schlenk"" equilibria. This is a significant problem in relation to their catalytic performance, and ligands need to be designed that are able to control or supress these processes. [2] In order to achieve our aims in catalysis, a significant amount of effort is spent on the development of new chiral ligands: we have recently reported a general route to a class of N-functionalised ethylene diamines,[1] which can be employed either as ligands in their own right, or as precursors for preparing imidazoline ligands.

"Outline The PhD will be based within the Cardiff Catalysis Institute (CCI) (www. cf. ac. uk/cci) which is one of the leading centres for catalyst research focussed on improving the understanding of catalysis, developing new catalytic processes with industry and promoting the use of catalysis as a sustainable 21st century technology. The project aims to develop new catalysts and processes to upgrade CO2 and hydrocarbons to more valuable products and to investigate the effects of microwave irradiation upon heterogeneous catalytic processes. Microwave assisted heterogeneous catalysis has been shown to give different results from conventional catalysis due to the different mechanisms of heating present in both the electric and magnetic fields of the microwave radiation. However, the reason for the differences observed in microwave and conventionally heated catalytic processes are not well understood and we will also aim to improve the fundamental knowledge related to microwave heated catalysis with our collaborators in Cardiff, the UK Catalysis Hub and overseas. During the PhD you will develop a number of practical skills including: • synthesising mixed metal oxide catalysts using different methods • characterising the catalysts using the facilities available in the CCI including (SEM, TEM, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy • testing the catalysts using conventional and microwave heated reactors Further details on the project are available from Dr Jonathan Bartley (http://www. cardiff. ac. uk/people/view/38550-bartley-jonathan).

"Outline Alzheimer's disease is one of the greatest healthcare challenges facing 21st century society. AD is associated with formation of fibrils and plaques in brain tissue that impair proper functioning of neurons. Plaques are formed by aggregation of amyloid-beta peptides that are soluble in isolation, but insoluble when bound to one another. The presence of metals, notably copper, zinc and iron, is a vital part of the aggregation and subsequent toxicity of amyloid beta peptides: increased levels of Cu and Zn are found in plaque regions of diseased brain, and those plaques which do not contain metal ions have been found to be non-toxic. Moreover, different metals such as platinum and ruthenium have been shown to inhibit aggregation, opening new avenues for treatment and diagnosis. Experiments to determine how metals might bind to amyloid beta peptides are difficult and costly to perform. In this light, using computers to simulate how metals bind to amyloid beta peptides and affect their structure and aggregation is an attractive proposition. This project will use modern simulation methods to describe in detail how metals bind to the peptides that cause AD, and the effect different metals have on their structure and aggregation characteristics. A suitable protocol for theoretical description of this important event must be able to properly describe the bonding and d-orbital effects that determine transition metal chemistry, while retaining the computational efficiency required for dynamical simulation of entire biomolecular systems. We have identified ligand field molecular mechanics (LFMM) as the ideal candidate for this task, as it efficiently and transferably captures the behaviour of metals. This project will use LFMM within molecular dynamics simulations to explicitly allow the peptide to change its shape in response to different metals. Crucially, the speed of LFMM coupled with the supercomputing resources available to us means that we can simulate the behaviour of two or more peptides together, and hence to examine the effect of metal on the initial stages of aggregation.

"Outline Dr Louis Morrill (https://www. cardiff. ac. uk/people/view/69691-morrill-louis) is looking for a PhD student to work on the research project ""Earth-Abundant First Row Transition Metal Catalysis for Diverse Alcohol Functionalization"". Research in the Morrill group is focused on inventing new reactions in organic chemistry and developing sustainable catalytic methodologies for synthesis. More details on Dr Morrill's research program can be found at: http://blogs. cardiff. ac. uk/themorrillgroup/. Alcohols are typically widely available, inexpensive and inert towards air, moisture and light, making them highly attractive starting materials for synthesis. The central goal of this PhD studentship will be to develop a variety of catalytic methodologies that enable the one-pot functionalization of commodity alcohol starting materials. Earth-abundant first row transition metal catalysis will be employed for hydrogen transfer processes, allowing simple alcohols to be used as alkylating agents in a variety of important C−N and C−C bond forming processes. Furthermore, through the productive merger with organocatalysis, dual catalytic approaches will be developed, accessing enantioenriched alpha-, beta-, and gamma-functionalized alcohols that would be very difficult or impossible to directly produce via existing methodologies. A highly motivated and dedicated student will gain a thorough training in synthetic organic chemistry and be rewarded with a highly stimulating project that will shape the future of this exciting new research program.

"Outline Colloidal nanostructures such as semiconductor quantum dots are relatively simple to manufacture, widely tuneable in shape and size and can be made of a large range of materials. They are useful as optical biomarkers, wavelength converters on light emitting diodes, for solar energy applications, and quantum information processing. For all these applications, a better understanding of the light-matter interaction properties of these nanostructures is needed. The proposed project investigates the quantum coherent light-matter interaction regime and associated carrier dynamics of electrons and holes in novel colloidal structures developed to achieve a dephasing time limited solely by the radiative lifetime. A variety of different structures will be investigated towards this goal. These include CdSe/ZnS platelets [Phys. Rev. B 91, 121302(R) (2015)], CdSe/CdS dots [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 087401 (2012)], InP/ZnSe dots, and perovskite quantum dots [Nano Lett. (2018) DOI 10. 1021/acs. nanolett. 8b03027]. These materials will be compared and contrasted with defect states in 1D materials (Carbon nanotubes) and 2D materials (transition metal dichalcogenides such as MoSe2 [Phys. Rev. B 96, 045407 (2017)]). Notably, blinking and jitter of the optical transitions in all these materials, due to charge fluctuations in the environment, is currently limiting their applicability for quantum optics. The origin of these effects will be determined in this project by using single emitter four-wave mixing and photoluminescence measurements, in order to reduce or eliminate these issues. You will perform the measurements using, and further developing, our world-leading heterodyne-detected four-wave mixing setup described in our recent publications, as given below. You will develop experimental skills and knowledge in optics & lasers by using femtosecond lasers systems and a complex optical setup. You will develop skills in programming by adapting the software to control the experiment. You will perform data analysis and modelling using the knowledge on the physical processes involved References: M. A. Becker et al. , Nano Lett. (2018) DOI 10. 1021/acs. nanolett. 8b03027 L.

"Outline This project in theoretical physics aims to study the coherent dynamics of optical excitations (excitons) in single and multiple semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) strongly coupled to photonic cavities. Your training and research will be in the areas of many-body theory of phonon-induced optical decoherence in QDs, quantum optics and QD-cavity quantum electrodynamics. In this project, coherent coupling and coherent control of remote QDs via optical resonators in optical circuits will be investigated. Such QDs play the role of isolated qubits, and their controlled coupling is of paramount importance for quantum technology applications. You will be calculating the excitonic absorption and photoluminescence in QDs coupled to optical cavities and waveguides, as well as the Purcell enhancement of their emission. You will be studying theoretically fundamental mechanisms of the acoustic-phonon induced dephasing and the Foerster transfer in electronically decoupled quantum dots with account for the acoustic-phonon environment. You will be using various methods of many-body theory including diagram techniques, density matrix approach with Lindblad dissipators, Trotter's decomposition, matrix cumulant expansion and so on. The project is embedded in a bigger EPSRC funded research activity at Cardiff School of Physics and Astronomy and will benefit from a close collaboration with an experimental research team working on the controlled long-range coherent coupling of quantum dots via cavities. Comparing theory with measured optical data, fundamental mechanisms of the coherent coupling will be understood and important parameters of the experimentally investigated systems will be extracted for predictive modelling of QDs embedded in complex quantum circuits. Our scientific excellence in this field is confirmed by research publications on this topic in Nature group journals: Nature Mater. 9, 304-308 (2010) and Nature Commun. 4:1747 (2013), as well as by the most recent theoretical work providing an exact solution of a long-standing fundamental problem of the phonon-induced decoherence of the QD-cavity system: arXiv:1807. 10977 (2018).

"Outline The proposed project spans from the field of optical spectroscopy of semiconductor nanostructures, specifically coherent spectroscopy of single quantum dots, to quantum computing, specifically the implementation of quantum operations in quantum dots. Technological advances in light detectors and microscopy techniques during the last decade have allowed the investigation of the emission properties of individual localized light emitters such as dye molecules, defects in semiconductors, or semiconductor quantum dots. The observation of coherence in these systems and their manipulation by coherent control is presently at the forefront of the research in the field, driven by the expectation that these techniques allow the implementation of quantum information processing using optical transitions in single quantum dots as qubits or to control spin q-bits. The goal of the project is the application of the unique experimental technique of heterodyne spectral interferometry (HSI) [Optics Letters 31, 1151 (2006)] to determine the coherent coupling structure in few-quantum-dot systems by two-dimensional four-wave mixing [Nature Photonics 5, 57 (2011)], and then use this knowledge to design optical control pulses to implement simple quantum gates in the few-quantum-dot system, again using HSI to read the result of the gate operations [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 266401 (2005)]. The detailed information about the quantum system gained by this detection scheme will be used to design the control pulse to a quantum gate of high fidelity. Previous experiments by the supervisor detected the coherent coupling between localized excitons in quantum wells [Nature Photonics 5, 57 (2011] and between quantum dots mediated by a cavity [Nature Communications 4, 1747 (2013)]. Recent work showed the multi-wave coherent control [Nature Photonics 10, 155 (2016)] and the radiatively limited dephasing of excitons in WS2 [2D Materials 5, 031007 (2018)]. The project is embedded in an ongoing EPSRC grant [EP/M020479/1] and will benefit from the support by one ongoing PhD and two PDRAs working on related topics and supporting the required experimental setups and theoretical predictions.

"Outline Achieving high performance, long lifetime, and electrical injection silicon-based lasers will deliver the last missing building block in silicon photonics, a platform that can not only enable optical interconnects, but also serve other growth markets such as cluster computing, light detection and ranging (LIDAR), machine vision and environmental sensing. This project aims to develop high-performance 1. 55 µm C-band quantum dot (QD) and nano lasers to benefit from the lowest fibre attenuations. Advanced heteroepitaxy techniques will be explored to yield highly strained nanostructures with superior optical qualities and low dislocation density III-V materials on silicon and silicon-on-insulator substrates. The material and device characteristics and possible light coupling schemes with silicon photonics will be investigated. The newly established metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) capability at Cardiff University and the availability of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) provides a complementary experimental setting for the study in this work. The project will concentrate on developing active device structures of 1. 55 µm QD lasers with an aim to achieve superior optical properties and improved gain characteristics. Cross-examination using AFM and PL can correlate the growth parameters, morphology and optical quality of the quantum dots. QD development on native InP wafers will be carried out in parallel with the development of InP growth on mismatched Si substrates. Electrically injected lasers with temperature-insensitive and low threshold current operation will be demonstrated to guide material development and optimisation.

"Outline Nonlinear PDEs (deterministic or stochastic coefficients) The project is in the area of stochastic homogenization for nonlinear PDEs (Partial Differential Equations) associated to a low regularity condition called the Hormander condition. In particular I am interested in those cases where, even starting from a stochastic microscopic model, the effective problem (= PDE modelling the macroscopic behaviour) is deterministic. Where the microscopic stochastic model is related to Hormander-type PDEs, the rescaling becomes usually anisotropic. The regularity theory of such PDEs mimics, at least in the linear case, the standard one (H ̈ormander's Theorem '69), but deriving finer properties like asymptotics in the presence of randomness requires an intricate combination of ideas from analysis, probability and geometry. The influence of the geometry on the associated analysis problems, is particularly evident in the case of homogenisation where the rescaling of the microscopic model is strictly connected to the underlying geometry. In fact, in the standard uniformly elliptic/parabolic case (respectively coercive for the first order case), one takes the limit as ε tends to zero of an equation depending on e. g. x/ε (where x is a point in Rn) i. e. isotropic rescaling. When considering a degen- erate PDE related to H ̈ormander vector fields, the rescaling becomes anisotropic: for example in the first Heisenberg group a point (x, y, z) scales as (x/ε, y/ε, z/ε2). Moreover points (elements on the manifold) and velocities of curves (elements in the tangent space) scale now in a very different way and any identification between objects with different natures (which is often a well-hidden key point in the stan- dard elliptic/parabolic case) is no longer allowed. The challenge in the study of these limit theorems is to find approaches which do not rely on the commutativity of the Euclidean structure or on the identification between manifold (points) and tangent space (velocities), and dealing with the dif- ficulty of using very degenerate underlying geometries which are not even locally isomorphic to the Euclidean Rn. The mathematical questions arising in the project are not only interesting from the pure mathematical point of view but they also have important applications in many different fields, for example in the study of the visual cortex (see Citti-Sarti model of the visual cortex) and financial models e. g. Asian options. One of the goals of the project is to provide error estimates for homogenisation problems, i. e. in cases where it is already known that solutions of the ε-problem converge to solutions of the homogenised problem we want to estimate the rate of convergence.

"Outline This project will aim to build on research by exploring novel reinforcement learning algorithms and/or other techniques from machine learning (such as deep learning). Background: The prisoner's dilemma continues to be a prime area of research used to understand emergent social behaviour as well as biologic behaviour such as tumour growth. This research project aims to contribute to this study by applying modern research techniques from other fields. For example, recent work within the group has shown the potential for self-recognition mechanisms to evolve using realistic reinforcement learning algorithms. Project aims and methods: The scope of the project is not limited to the prisoner's dilemma but will almost certainly make use of a lot of computational expertise. Candidates willing to increase their skills in research software engineering should find this particularly interesting. Furthermore, there is scope to apply analytical game theoretic method to not only understand the potential for training mechanism but find bounds on performance as well as optimise certain micro behaviours.

"Outline One of the most highly debated questions in the field of animal swarming and social behaviour, is the collective random patterns and chaotic behaviour formed by some animal species, in particular fish schooling. Recently, we found that some fish species do not have preferred orientation and they swarm in a random pattern mode. Nevertheless, there is a clear coordinated movement of the school as a whole. The proposed project aims on developing a theoretical model for three-dimensional random movement in fish schools, with the absence of a centralized coordination. This is a multidisciplinary inter-institute project that requires training in biological fluid mechanics, with emphasis on potential flow theory, on one hand, and control and graph theory on the other. In addition, the PhD student will need to undertake computations of large fish schools that might require developing his/her skills handling large data and using a super computer.

"Outline The project seeks to bring together two different but complementary fields of mathematics in order to extract further understanding from each. Background: Locusts and other migrating insects can form cohesive swarms at large population densities, which subsequently travel over huge distances and can have a devastating effect on agriculture. It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms governing how the population decides collectively on the direction of migration and the population density at which this occurs. There has been much interest recently regarding the modelling of such animal movement. Specifically, as mathematicians we try to express animal interactions mechanistically, with a view to understanding emergent group phenomena, such as swarming and directionality. Critically, there are multiple ways of understanding such phenomena. Two such ways are through using game theoretic techniques (Vince Knight's (VK) area of expertise), whilst another is through using agent based modelling and the weak noise limit (Thomas Woolley's (TW) and Louise Dyson's (LD) area of expertise). This project seeks to bridge the gap between these two complementary skill sets in order to understand the role of noise in agent based decision making and specify how individual actions can lead to global decision making. Our initial point of interest is a recent minimal model of collective motion (developed by LD). The model describes density-dependent bistability in population-level decision making. This model demonstrates a kind of bistability that is only present when demographic noise is included. Namely, the randomness in the system does not simply cause transitions between different population states (e. g. individual left movement vs individual right movement) but instead actively constructs new possible population states (globally organised movement). We seek to use game theoretic approaches (a specific example being the Ohtsuki-Nowak approximation) that will allow us to remove topology from this problem and, thus, lead to a dramatic simplification. This simplification will shed light on the creation of the new states that depend on randomness, thus, generalising the cases in which we would expect noise dependent dynamics to occur. In turn, this will highlight ecological cases were such complexity would be expected to arise. The project will be co-supervised by Dr Louise Dyson, University of Warwick.

"Outline In this project you will learn about different methods for tackling combinatorial optimisation problems using both exact and approximate (heuristic) algorithms. A number of interesting problems have recently been proposed in the literature that involve identifying groups of closely related people in social networks. This could be used, for example, to help identify community structures in or to predict people's memberships of groups when this information is not available. These sorts of problems take ideas from area like graph colouring, but are very different in their underlying structure. A PhD in this area would focus on some of these problems and would design and test various heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms for the problem. Upper and lower bounds may also be proposed, where appropriate.

"Outline The terminology ""big data"" is generally used to refer to datasets that are too large or complex for traditional data-processing technics to adequately deal with them. The application to such datasets of modern machine learning techniques therefore raises many theoretical and numerical challenges. The numerical complexity inherent to the processing of a dataset indeed generally grows polynomially with its size, compromising de facto the analysis of very large datasets. In addition, the treatment of complex datasets often results in models involving a large number of parameters, making such models difficult to train while increasing the risk of overfitting and limiting their interpretability. Since such large-scale datasets are more and more common, their efficient processing is of great importance, not only at a purely scientific level, but also for many industrial and real-life applications. In parallel with the use of high-performance computing solutions (e. g. , parallelisation, computation using graphic processing units), many alternatives exist to try to overcome the difficulties inherent to the learning-with-big-data framework. For instance, problems related to the size of the datasets might be addressed through sample-size and dimension reduction techniques, while feature extraction, low-dimensional approximation or sparsity-inducing penalisation techniques might be used to prevent the model complexity to explode. Such operations need however to be applied with great care since they might have a significant impact on the quality of the final model, their effects being in addition often intrinsically connected. To make matters worse, the existing theory surrounding such approximation techniques is generally quite modest. The main objective of this project is to investigate the design of efficient approaches to scale-up and improve state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, while providing theoretical guarantees on their behaviour. A special emphasis will be drawn on sample size reduction and feature extraction procedures based on the notion of kernel discrepancy (also referred to as maximum mean discrepancy). Thanks to its ability to characterise representative samples, this notion has recently emerged as a powerful concept in machine learning, statistics and approximation theory (cf. reference 1. in section 4. 2); combined with auto-encoder techniques, it is for instance at the core of recent developments in Generative Adversarial Networks (the MMD-GAN method). Investigating to what extent this type of approaches can be generalised is one of the main motivations behind this project. What is funded Self-funded students only.

"Outline Many phenomena in the natural and social sciences can be modeled on a small (or microscopic) scale by many 'particles' that change their state according to a random input (noise) and the state of the others, think of molecules in solution or agents in a market. Due to the high dimensionality, these models are difficult to analyse computationally. On a larger scale, however, the behaviour of such systems can often be described by differential equations which are numerically much more tractable. This leads to the problem of scale bridging, ie how to connect rigorously these different descriptions at different scales by proving limit theorems. The topic of scale-bridging is a long-standing challenge for mathematics. In the explanation of his sixth problem, Hilbert set the task 'of developing mathematically the limiting process… which lead from the atomistic view to the laws of motion of continua'. Scale-bridging lies at the intersection of several mathematical disciplines. The focus of the project is on applying two new mathematical developments for the purpose of scale bridging. First, the theory of gradient flows and Wasserstein metrics developed by Otto and co-authors and for the first time applied to the analysis of interacting particle systems by the first supervisor and co-authors (ADPZ 2013), and second the recent progress in the theory of stochastic homogenisation by Armstrong, Cardaliaguet, Souganidis and others.

"Outline In today's environment where computer processors are powerful and computer memory cheap, researchers are able to collect and store huge amounts of data. Analysing that data needs sophisticated statistical and computational methods as most classic statistical methodology was developed at an era where data collection was not as easy and datasets where a lot of orders of magnitude smaller. Sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) is a class of methods for feature extraction in regression and classification problems with the purpose of reducing the size of a multidimensional dataset to a few important features. This has the potential of improving visualization of the most important relationships between the variables. This project will focus on the improvement of existing methodology for more accurate and computationally faster estimation algorithms to achieve SDR. Among the most interesting suggestions in the literature uses machine learning algorithms and more specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM). The method although powerful can be improved in different directions and therefore there are a number of directions that a student can take on this project. A few examples are: to derive new SDR methodology robust to outliers; to derive Sparse SDR methodology; to derive SDR methodology when we have missing predictors; to derive SDR methodology for functional data and many more. Moreover there are many modern applications (like text data analysis) where the data are really high-dimensional and not derived from a Gaussian distribution. In those cases, the literature is rather thin in computationally effective methods for efficient dimension reduction. We are looking into developing both supervised and unsupervised dimension reduction methods (like non-Gaussian PCA, non-Gaussian CCA etc) which are computationally efficient and accurate in the results especially in the nonlinear feature extraction setting. Interested students can look into a number of directions sparse methodology, real time algorithms or applications to real datasets. What is funded Self-funded students only.

"Outline The main goal of this project is to develop mathematical methods for the mathematically rigorous analysis of the properties of interfaces evolving in a heterogeneous, random environment, described on a small scale by nonlinear PDEs with random coefficients. It is motivated by the following situation: With an interface is associated a scalar quantity called its energy (think eg of its area) which it tries to decrease, ie, it performs a gradient flow. This energy is perturbed through obstacles or impurities on a very small scale, and the system is driven by some large-scale force. The impurities are random, ie we have information only on the probability of finding certain impurities in a certain place, not on their precise nature and location. We are interested in the effective velocity and other qualitative properties of the interface on a large scale, much larger than the scale on which the perturbations vary. On that scale, the perturbations should 'average out', but we can ask the following natural questions: What is the effective evolution law on a large scale, and what are the qualitative properties of the interface, eg on which scales does it look rough due to all the random heterogeneities? (The latter is related to the question of error estimates. ) How does all this depend on the law of the impurities?

"Outline Service composition is a collection of services where, many smaller services are combined together to a larger service. Service composition is the problem of aggregating services in such a way that given (functional and not functional) requirements are satisfied. Typically, Web service composition is represented by a plan consisting of tasks that, at run-time, are instantiated to the actual services satisfying users' requirements. Due to the increasing number of services available offering similar functionalities, it is hard for users to select an optimal service composition among a list of candidate services that satisfy their needs. Service composition is comparatively old research area within computer science. Most of the early work has been done by the web services community specially focusing web service composition domain. Most popular web services composition problem is Travel Planning problem. Over the years, many researchers have proposed many different techniques to address the problem. Let us now look at this problem from Internet of Things (IoT) point of view. Internet of Things is a network of devices (including sensors). The devices are heterogeneous and varies from each other significantly. Ideal vision (at least most of the time) is to develop IoT applications with the help of already deployed devices. Each of the devices may have different capabilities therefore may only capable of running certain type of devices. For example, a particular IoT application may need to compose certain type of devices together to accomplish its end goal. Further, due to heterogeneity and constraints, certain services may only be able to run on certain device. Form abstract point of view, this is a very similar to the problem we have dealt in web services domain. We believe that IoT can be greatly benefitted by the techniques developed by webservices composition community and other similar communities. IoT is a applied domain where the community composed from research scientist to software developers to hobbyist to teenager who may tinkering IoT application. As most of the work related web services composition is done by research community, knowledge seems to be stuck within the research community where it is different for developers to use the techniques developed in service composition domain.

"Outline This project will investigate the design and development of an end-to-end, distributed, Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure to support sustainable wildlife conservation. This project would enable the lead-supervisor to start a larger collaboration between academics in the Schools of Computer Science and Informatics (COMSC) and Biosciences (BIOSI). The PhD student will research on using IoT technologies to facilitate and augment wildlife conservation activities in-the-wild. The primary testbed for this project will be Cardiff University's Danau Girang Field Centre (DGFC) in the Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary (LKWS; Sabah, Malaysia). One main challenge in performing data driven research in-the-wild is deployment of efficient and effective sensing infrastructure to collect and analyse data in a sustainable manner. Traditional data analytics approaches are designed to send all the data to the cloud for decision making; however, areas such as LKWS and other protected areas in Sabah, network communication is very poor or not existent. Further, continuous data communication consumes a significant amount of energy which most of the edge nodes cannot afford. Therefore, traditional approaches are ineffective and unsustainable. Traditionally, self-organizing (dynamic orchestration) algorithms are designed to work assisted by a central node (e. g. cloud). In this project, (novelty) our aim is to develop algorithms that can run on resource constrained edge nodes without the support of a central node. In this project, our focus will be on (exact focus depends on candidate's skill-set): • Architecture: Design and development of self-organizing and reconfigurable IoT infrastructure that integrates resources from multiple layers (sensing, edge/fog, cloud). Low-cost and off-the-shelf components will be used to develop the prototype. • Algorithms: o Design and development of distributed algorithms that can dynamically orchestrate IoT resources on the edge to satisfy a given sensing requirement without continuous connectivity to the cloud. o These algorithms will also determine how to distribute data analytics workloads (among heterogeneous edge nodes) in an optimal way to satisfy given requirements and real-world constraints.

"Outline The Knowledge Management Fund (KMF) is the Knowledge Platform's fund to support activities arising from its network. The small-scale grants awarded by the Fund offer a low barrier to entry for pioneering, agile and experimental proposals. The aim of the Fund is to improve policies and programs, particularly in Fragile and Conflict-Affected Settings (FCAS), by diversifying thinking and evidence in the Security & Rule of Law (SRoL) field. The KMF is a €300,000 annual fund that awards grants of up to €15,000 for events, research ideas and innovative projects that contribute to high-quality knowledge and learning in the SRoL field, and the subsequent use of that knowledge and learning in programming and policy. The 2019 KMF thematic headlines are Change and Learning Processes and Examining and Improving Policy. Each year, the Secretariat sets these headlines following consultation with the KPSRL, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), and the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research-Science for Global Development (NWO-WOTRO). The thematic headlines help applicants to the KMF focus on outcomes, and they reflect the fund's specific added value: addressing emerging priority areas and feeding research outcomes and original ideas into programming and policies. They are purposefully broad to leave as much scope as possible for applicants to generate knowledge in their specialist thematic and geographic areas. The KMF is divided into three strands. The three strands are Events, Research and Innovation. This helps applicants maintain focus on the method by which they try to achieve their aim of producing original insights to improve the quality and use of knowledge in programming and policy. What is funded In 2019, the KMF is changing its focus: away from topic-based headlines (such as human security or transitional justice) to focus more on how and why knowledge is generated and used. This will help projects feed more directly into the knowledge-brokering role of the Secretariat. It will also build on learning from programs that is practically useful for practitioners and policymakers. This new focus acknowledges the diversity of security and rule of law expertise within our network, and offers applicants to the KMF the flexibility to develop ideas that tackle urgent and emerging issues, based on their knowledge of the many dimensions of fragile contexts. Applicants' submissions will be assessed on their alignment with the chosen headline. Applicants may freely choose their topical focus within the security and rule of law (SRoL) field. This could include, but is not limited to: human security, justice and security sector reform, informal justice, access to justice, transitional justice, political governance, informal and local governance, and political representation. Please read the explanation for the two headlines below carefully, as each has different requirements. Not every topic within the security and rule of law field will automatically be relevant for each headline. Each applicant will need to justify their choice of topic and its relevance to a specific headline in their proposals. 1. Change and Learning Processes This headline explores how change and learning happens in the field of SRoL. Specifically, this theme will help shed light on the exact mechanisms by which people, organizations and institutions working on SRoL change and learn. This can be in a number of ways: within programs, through feedback loops between practice and policymaking, and how learning and knowledge that has been gained or generated is identified and used. Example areas for investigation might include (but are not limited to): how people, organizations and institutions practically diverge from established and conventional practices. how research methods and partnerships adapt more effectively to fragile contexts. how we can combine qualitative and quantitative approaches in measuring change. why barriers exist to more adaptive programming approaches and what can be done to overcome them or use the opportunities that do exist. Projects under this headline should produce knowledge about change and learning processes relevant for and shareable with the wider KPSRL community. 2. Examining and Improving Policy There is an increasing focus on and demand for evidence and research in policymaking, including in the field of SRoL. While new evidence is being generated every day, there are still many evidence gaps on the assumptions that underpin policy within the SRoL field. These might include the assumed positive effect of particular sectors, such as the private sector, on peace and stability, or the assumed positive impact of specific policies. There are also policy gaps rather than evidence gaps. This headline aims to explore these issues by focusing on the SRoL policies of programming and policy actors. Projects under this headline could focus on (but are not limited to): generating new evidence or identifying 'what works' within the SRoL field, with the aim of informing policy helping programming and policy actors develop and improve their SRoL policies disseminating existing evidence to a wider policy and practice audience measuring the impact of policies testing the quality of evidence available for policymakers and practitioners Projects under this headline should identify a specific policy (gap) or policy area of a SRoL programming or policy actor where possible, and produce findings relevant for the wider KPSRL community. Aims and focus The KMF is particularly interested in bringing wider and more diverse perspectives and sources of evidence into SRoL policy and programming. Applications are open to any consortium or individual with the ambition to improve policies, programs or knowledge in the field of security and rule of law in fragile and conflict affected settings. Think-tanks, (I)NGOs, academics, universities, private sector organizations, government institutions, journalists, independent researchers or innovators, data specialists, learning experts, and PhD candidates are all welcome to submit proposals. Partnerships between individuals and organizations and across the range of sectors within our network are highly encouraged. In particular, the KMF welcomes partnerships that link people from different regions of the globe. Preference is given to those projects focused on the Dutch MFA policy priority regions: the Middle East and North Africa, the Horn of Africa and the Sahel. The KMF will only fund costs that are directly attributable to the project, up to €15,000. All costs - especially salaries, personnel and fee days - must be substantiated and justified. The KMF will not cover overheads or any expenses that fall outside the budget agreed in the signed contract. All applicants must contribute an additional 20% to the funds sought. Please see below and the budget template for the full budget guidelines and requirements. Project strands The KMF is made up of three strands to which you may apply: Events, Research, and Innovation. Each strand funds different kinds of activities and initiatives that, collectively, aim to produce original insights to help the KPSRL improve the quality and use of knowledge and learning in programming and policy. The KMF is interested in three dimensions of knowledge: production, dissemination, and use. Each application must: generate new research - it fills gaps where there is insufficient knowledge or expertise available link existing knowledge and actors - it addresses a lack of awareness or understanding of existing knowledge break down the barriers for learning and change within or between people, institutions and organizations - it addresses use of what knowledge and learning already exists, which is either ignored or not made available to policymakers and programmers. Duration In 2019, the KMF application process opens on 15 March 2019. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis from 15 March until 15 November 2019. There are four decision dates throughout the year, with corresponding submission deadlines. Applications submitted before a submission deadline will be given a decision no later than the next decision date. Any applications submitted after the submission deadline will be assessed and given a decision on the decision date - i. e. an application submitted on 21 June will be given a decision on 8 July. The dates are listed below: Submission Deadline: 26 April / Decision Date: 13 May Submission Deadline: 21 June / Decision Date: 8 July Submission Deadline: 13 September / Decision Date: 30 September Submission Deadline: 15 November / Decision Date: 2 December Eligibility All applications must: Include a prospective budget not to exceed €15,000, with 20% co-funding committed, that complies with all guidelines and requirements as detailed in the budget template Begin within 6 weeks of funds being awarded, with a running time not exceeding 6 months Due to the amount of applications received, applications that do not meet the eligibility criteria will not be assessed. If you have any questions regarding your application's eligibility please contact KMF@kpsrl. org before submission. Assessment Criteria All applications should: Explain how the project aligns with one of the Platform's Thematic Headlines Describe the specific knowledge and/or capacity gap to be addressed, and argue its urgency Describe how the project will be both unique and applicable to the SRoL field Demonstrate a clear benefit to the larger Platform community through identifying a minimum of two accessible deliverables Clearly define the change sought and strategy to effect that change Display the ambition to build upon proposed project in the future Have an original idea or approach"

"Outline The design of experiments is an area of mathematical sciences which has direct economic impact. Optimal designs allow saving time, materials and other resources. New design methodologies are required due to growing complexity of real world problems, for example, technological changes in quality and quantity of measured data. The theory of the design of experiments involves statistical, optimization and simulation principles, various mathematical techniques and extensive computing. The theory of statistical experimental design is an important link between the experimental and the modelling worlds. Designing experiments aims at extracting the maximal information from an experiment. Up to now the theory of experimental design mostly deals with uncorrelated observations. In most modern applications, however, the experimental observations are correlated. The whole philosophy of experimental design in this case becomes more complicated. The project is interdisciplinary in nature and will include elements of theoretical probability and applied statistics. What is funded Self-funded students only How to Apply Applicants should submit an application for postgraduate study via the online application service http://www. cardiff. ac. uk/study/postgraduate/research/programmes/programm. . .

About RE-DACT: Disinformation and conspiracy theories are in no way new phenomena but the development of the internet and social media in recent decades has resulted in an exponential rise in the exposure to, and spreading of, disinformation and conspiracy theories. At an individual level, these phenomena may influence health related decisions (e. g. , not accepting a certain medical treatment) as well as environmentally behaviours (such as not believing in reports of climate change) and therefore not reducing actions that may negatively affect climate and environment. On a societal level, disinformation and conspiracy theories are related to, for instance, decreasing trust in politicians, mainstream media, social institutions, pharmaceutical companies and health care, and decreasing probability of participation in democratic processes (such as voting). The increased spreading of and exposure to disinformation, alternative truths and conspiracy theories constitute a vast global societal challenge. RE-DACT has been created with the purpose of developing and conducting interdisciplinary research within this field, and to also offer education to organisations on the topic of disinformation and conspiracy theories.

"Extreme events put to the test by AI We aim to predict, without a model, the dynamics of partially observable complex systems. Under the name of complex systems, we find dynamic systems describing the evolution of markets, climate, epidemics, a laser or a fluid. This great diversity of system explains the universality of the behaviors that they can present. It is this same diversity that explains the importance represented by the challenge of predicting them. The most symptomatic example is that of the climate. Under the influence of climate change, brief, high-amplitude and more less localized fluctuations are likely to be more frequent. Hence the need to be able to predict them with advances allowing effective decision- making to limit their impacts. This task is historically based on the mathematical modeling and the numerical resolution of these models. However, recent developments in terms of machine learning now make it possible to address the predictability of complex dynamic systems without a mathematical model. The potential offered by these algorithms is likely to be diminished by the fact that complex systems are rarely observable in their entirety. In this project, we will develop a method to predict locally and without model the complex dynamics of chaotic systems with a large degree of freedom. Our overall strategy is based on using the production or destruction of information, namely entropy to identify the precursors of complex evolutions. This will make it possible to lift an important lock in the prediction of brief, high-amplitude, and localized events: ""where"" and ""when"" to trigger the prediction. Particular attention will be paid to ring resonators based on photonic fibers and the dynamics of the frequency combs they generate. Profile of the candidate The applicants will have a strong background in physics, electrical engineering, or engineering science, with previous training in optoelectronics, optics and laser physics an advantage. The thesis is either theoretical/numerical work and experiment in fiber optics. He must have excellent computer skills. Contract Details 36 months starting from October 2022. Salary is approximately 2000 €/month before tax according the level fixed by the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research and Innovation. "

"The study of nanoscale systems is an area of research with great potential at both the fundamental and applied levels. This involves the development of synthetic methodologies capable of generating highly complex but controlled molecular structures, and the emergence of sophisticated experimental methods capable of studying and positioning these materials down to the single molecule level. A particularly important target has been the construction and characterization of single-molecule electronic devices, as these represent the ultimate limit of miniaturization. Electrochromic materials are known to undergo changes in their electronic absorption bands in a reversible manner due to interconversion between two or more redox states in response to applied potentials. [1-4] The development of new electrochromic materials with good operational stability, optical contrast, coloring efficiency, and fast response time has seen significant progress for potential applications such as information storage and optical storage, smart windows, and color displays. The most frequently studied electrochromic molecules are conductive organic polymers [5-8] which can be optionally modified with organic side functions contributing to improve their optical properties. [9] Iron(II) polypyridyl complexes are of great interest for the construction of electrochromic materials due to their chromophoric character (absorption bands in the visible range, variable depending on the oxidation state of the transition metal) as well as their exceptional stability. However, their structuring at the nanoscale remains a challenge and some binuclear polypyridyl iron(II) complexes simply cannot be formed in solution (unlike similar ruthenium-based complexes) due to ligand exchange. Thus, obtaining ideal structures consisting of individual molecular wires ensuring fast electronic communication remains difficult and becomes extremely important in this context. The phenomenon of polychromism induced by redox processes and the fabrication of these materials in a practical configuration are related challenges. Accurately aligning donor-acceptors (D-A) is an important target in materials development for improved device performance. For example, mutual D-A orientation can promote unidirectional charge and energy transfer, enabling better control of the electrical and optical properties of the materials. [10] The objective of this thesis will be to design, fabricate and characterize photo-/electrochromic devices based on multinuclear metal polypyridyl complexes confined within oriented mesoporous films prepared by combining electrochemistry and click chemistry. The targeted molecular platforms will involve the immobilization of terpyridine ligands in the mesoporous channels followed by a derivatization exploiting, on the one hand, the ability of these ligands to form coordination complexes with transition metals and, on the other hand, the use of polypyridyl bridging ligands in order to modulate the strength of the metal-metal interactions through the conjugated ligand and thus control the degree of electron delocalization. We will thus obtain nanostructured thin films with oriented porosity presenting (photo-)electrochromic properties modulated by the applied potential and/or light. The thesis work will include three important parts: 1) Synthesis of organic ligands and metal complexes. 2) Characterization: The classical characterization methods (NMR, IR. ) will be used. The optical and electrochemical properties of the synthesized compounds will also be studied by absorption spectrometry (UV-visible) and cyclic voltammetry. 3) Preparation and functionalization of vertically-oriented mesoporous silica films. The host group, localized at the Laboratoire de Chimie Physique et Microbiologie pour les Matériaux et l'Environnement at the Université de Lorraine possesses recognized experience in preparation and functionalization of mesoporous materials and electrode surfaces. This thesis will be supervised by Dr. Neus Vila (MdC-UL), ELAN group of the LCPME. Required skills: The candidate is expected to have skills in organic synthesis as well as experience in the use of classical characterization and analysis tools (NMR spectro, mass, etc). Moreover, an interest in the field of electrochemistry will be appreciated. Funding from Université de Lorraine for 3 years from October 1st, 2022.

"Outline Arronax Nantes is a stakeholder in the I-SITE NExT, in close interaction with the LabEx IRON and SIRIC ILIAD. The preferred themes relate to fundamental research in physics, chemistry and biology and translational research in nuclear medicine. Full description of the project Scandium radionuclides were identified in the late 1990s as promisingfor nuclear medicine applications. Among the various scandium isotopes, 43Sc and 44Sc are interesting for PET imaging while 47Sc is interesting for therapy. The pairs 44Sc/47Sc or 43Sc/47Sc could therefore be considered as true pairs Theranostics Another interesting aspect of scandium is that its chemistry is governed by the ion trivalent, Sc3+. When combined with its hardness and size, it gives this element a behavior similar to that of lanthanides. It is then also possible to use it in a theranostic approach in combination with 177Lu or other lanthanides. The objective of this work is therefore to finalize the production of the PET isotope of 44Sc and to look lanthanides which could be used in therapeutic application. Among the lanthanides therapeutics of interest that can be coupled to Scandium, we can cite 169Er, 165Er, 166Ho, 161Tb, and 135La. Among them, 165Er and 135La can be produced advantageously by accelerator for nuclear medicine applications.

"Outline A three-year funded PhD position is open for interdisciplinary research in numerical studies of electro-mechano-biology (EMB) and microfluidics engineering of cell permeabilization. Looking at the boundary of physics, mechanics and biology, the problem of cell membrane permeabilization presents an excellent opportunity for cross-disciplinary science and engineering and a context in which fundamental physics is called for to answer complex questions. Hence, many topics in biology comprise a growing area of inter-disciplinary science and provide significant opportunities for the application of the first-principles of physics. Additionally, due to the large separation of length scales between the membrane thickness and the size of the cytoplasm, it is challenging to understand quantitatively the electromechanical couplings in these systems. With developing advanced multiphysics and multiscale numerical analysis we expect to learn many cross-properties of biological materials which involve multiple spatial or temporal scales. Since EMB involves a broad range of length scales (from nm (membrane thickness) through mm (cell size) up to cm (tissue sample)) and timescales (from ns to h), understanding its first-principles features requires a multiscale modeling approach, ranging from molecular simulations to large-scale continuum models of cells and tissues. What is funded The PhD student will be assigned to my group for this project. He or she will spend several months in European or American groups via the PhD mobility program of UBO. Apart from the regular contact with local partners, meetings are planned on a regular basis where experimental and numerical results will be discussed. Plans for further development of the project will be outlined and adjustment of the project deadlines will be performed during these meetings. Deliverables of this project will consist of a set of publications in high impact factor peer-reviewed journals, communications in major international conferences and possibly a patent dealing with microfluidics. Due to its multidisciplinary character, the public engagement of the research concepts and results will be achieved through public talks and open lab days such as Fête de la Science. Duration 3 years Eligibility Location: Brest, France Start: October 2022 The successful candidate should have a Master Degree in physics, biophysics, or mechanical engineering, with a strong background in computational analysis relevant to the research program. Experience with quantitative electromagnetic simulation tools (finite-element, Comsol Multiphysics) is mandatory. Gross salary: 2000€/month Qualified applicants are invited to send curriculum vitae, publication list, and contact information for two references via e-mail, or fax to : Prof. Christian Brosseau, Lab-STICC, Université de Brest, 6 avenue Le Gorgeu, CS 93837, 29285 Brest Cedex 3, France ; Tel. : 33-298016105, FAX: 33-298016131, e-mail : brosseau@univ-brest. fr"

"Outline TU Dublin has created a Crisis Support Fund that will provide assistance to researchers fleeing crisis situations. Across the World, researchers face threats to their life, their freedom, and their careers in research. Often, they are forced to flee their home country because of such threats, and actively seek opportunities to restart their work in a supportive university environment. The ongoing war resulting from the invasion of Ukraine by the government of the Russian Federation, has brought support for fleeing researchers into focus for many of us in the TU Dublin community. This has motivated us to initiate a long term fund that can be used for support of researchers fleeing crises anywhere in the World What is funded. The initial focus of the fund will be on PhD students of any nationality, previously registered in a Ukrainian university, who are fleeing the war in Ukraine. The intention is to support a small number of continuing PhD students, who would register as TU Dublin students and will be provided with: Fully supported tuition fees A stipend to cover living costs for the remainder of their time registered as a TU Dublin PhD student Research costs Assistance in settling into life in Dublin Pastoral supports, including availability of counselling Duration For the time spent registered in TU Dublin Eligibility The initial focus of the fund will be on PhD students of any nationality, previously registered in a Ukrainian university, who are fleeing the war in Ukraine"

"Of more than 50,000 known edible plant species, the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that only three crops - rice, wheat and maize - account for two-thirds of the world's food supply. As a result, many nutritious, resilient crops remain underutilized, contributing to poor dietary diversity and health outcomes. FFAR partnered with the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) to launch Harvest for Health initiative to accelerate the development of underutilized crops, increasing the diversity of foods in the marketplace. The model developed through this initiative will predict underutilized crops' potential as sources of functional and nutritious ingredients that could replace, complement or aid in reformulating the existing food products or developing new ones. Why Underutilized Crops?Underutilized crops can help ensure nutritional security in the face of climate change and provide diverse economic opportunities to growers. Additionally, consumers are increasingly seeking healthier, sustainable food products and global flavor-driven food experiences. Introducing new and exciting nutritious foods with various tastes and flavors will expand the food and agriculture industry's consumer base and contribute to our food system's health and environmental sustainability. Breakthrough Crop ChallengeWhile underutilized crops have incredible functional and nutritional potential, the development of such crops for consumption or use in other products is prohibitively expensive and time-intensive. To attract more private sector investment in underutilized crop development, Harvest for Health is launching the Breakthrough Crop Challenge to develop a predictive model that can screen underutilized crops to determine a crop's usefulness as a source of functional ingredients or nutrients.

"This competitive fellowship aims to spur and foster disruptive innovation in the next generation of fertilizer research and development through a research challenge, whereby emerging young scientists in agriculture research can enhance their efforts in fertilizer efficiency research and technology development. The technologies and research generated through this project will address the need for increasing plant uptake of essential macronutrients and limit the loss of inputs - which contribute largely to water and marine ecosystem damage - while boosting productivityThe FFAR-OCP Disruptive Technology Fellowship (FFAR-OCP Fellowship) supports research in the following areas:The FFAR-OCP Fellowship provides stipend support for up to five early career scientists (within up to ten years of receiving PhD) and seeks to enable high impact research in the focus areas of the project. Awardees will receive a maximum of $75,000 and will cover 12-24 months of funding to conduct projects in fertilizer efficiency research and technology development that have already demonstrated promise in a first phase of research and would clearly benefit from a catalytic push to achieve proof of concept or early product development to progress to a second phase. The FFAR-OCP Fellowship will not support brand new research proposals without any prior history of research progress. The awardees will also receive a certificate and be named as OCP/FFAR disruptive fertilizer technology fellows. Fellows may be extended the opportunity to partner with OCP and the Mohammed VI Polytechnic University in Morocco to co-develop novel fertilizer products that could be highly efficient both for high production and low input agriculture following the completion of the project.

"Food production faces a range of challenges from climate change, competition for scarce resources and supply chain disruptions. One solution is controlled environment agriculture, which offers the ability to develop varieties of crops in controlled, non-traditional spaces. Controlled environment agriculture can also enhance desirable traits in crops. Current public funding for controlled environment agriculture is lagging the private sector, where funding is largely spent on engineering, lighting and other tools. However, a successful controlled environment agriculture industry will depend on profitably growing a diverse range of crops indoors, a task requiring adaptation of the crops themselves for controlled environment growth. To foster the development of controlled environment agriculture science, FFAR's Precision Indoor Plants (PIP) consortium is seeking research applications focused on understanding the genetic and biochemical elements responsible for premium strawberry flavors, in addition to the environmental control of these elements. Strawberries have a range of diverse flavors that have been lost in modern varieties but that still exist in nature. This funding opportunity aims to build on existing strawberry research, including flavor research, to increase scientific understanding of premium flavors in strawberry and how flavorful strawberries can impact the controlled environment agriculture sector. By understanding genetic and environmental influences on flavor, we can not only recover these flavors, but also expand our abilities to adapt crops to controlled environment agriculture. "
"Fund for Innovation in Development The Fund for Innovation in Development (FID) is a new initiative to support innovation that contributes to reducing global poverty and inequality. Through flexible grant funding, FID enables innovators and researchers to test new ideas, build rigorous evidence of what works, and scale the highest-impact and most cost- effective solutions. What FID does 1. Innovation funding to alleviate poverty and inequality Innovation is essential to the global fight against poverty and inequality, particularly in the world's poorest countries. Around the world, new approaches, policies and programs are impacting the ways in which governments, businesses and NGOs work to improve the well-being of the most vulnerable. To identify and scale the most promising solutions, FID Board Chair and 2019 Nobel Laureate Esther Duflo proposes a paradigm shift in our approach to tackling poverty and inequality: rather than making decisions based on general theories, specific solutions can be scientifically tested to assess their effectiveness and funding decisions can - and should - be based on evidence. Innovation is central to accelerating a more just and inclusive world. FID embodies this idea by offering a renewed approach to development assistance, providing grant funding to test new ideas, experiment and demonstrate - based on rigorous evaluation methods - what works in development, and scale the most efficient solutions with the greatest positive impact. FID accepts applications: for innovations in any sector, and specifically encourages applications for solutions in education, health, climate change, and gender equality for innovations in all low- and middle-income countries, and specifically encourages applications from the priority countries for French aid from nearly any type of applicant, including researchers, governments, NGOs and for-profit companies. 2. FID's Core Principles FID makes funding decisions based on three core principles: Rigorous proof of impact on improving the living conditions of people living in poverty. Evidence of clear, measurable outcomes demonstrates what works in the fight against poverty and inequality. FID relies on rigorous evidence of causal impact in determining which innovations to fund, and supports research to generate evidence on development innovations. Cost-effectiveness in the achievement of specific development objectives, compared to existing approaches. Taking a best-in-class approach to cost-effectiveness, FID invests in innovations that have the potential to deliver more impact for every euro than alternative solutions. Potential for scale, widespread adoption, and sustainability. FID's ultimate goal is to support impactful development solutions that will replicate and scale to improve millions of lives while being financially sustained through the public and/or private sector. 3. Trajectories for scaling innovations Innovations can generally be scaled up through one of three pathways: Public scaling: An innovation designed to be scaled up with the financial support of developing country governments, donors, or philanthropists. Commercial scaling: An innovation designed to be scaled up as a business, financed, for example, by customer payments, and earned revenue, investments, or commercial capital. Hybrid scaling: An innovation designed to be scaled up through a combination of commercial and public channels (e. g. , partly through donor or philanthropic grant funding and partly through earned income, such as a government paying or subsidizing the cost of a marketed product or service that improves the lives of the poor).

The key date for the twelve-year limit is 1 October of the year following your application. Please initially send us your CV so we can advise you. (info[at]avh. de). Academic host Who can be my host? Any natural person with close ties to a public or private institution in Germany (e. g. businesses, associations, public administration, NGOs) can serve as a host. To ensure adequate support, there must be some relation between your host's field of professional expertise and your proposed project in Germany. What are the host's/mentor's responsibilities? The host's principal task is to create the conditions essential to carrying out your project in Germany and aid you in establishing any necessary contacts (e. g. to gain access to institutions in Germany). Depending on the requirements of the project, your collaboration with your host may take various forms - from regular contact to close cooperation. How can I find a host? You choose your host/mentor yourself. We cannot provide any direct assistance in searching for a host. Applicants often turn to existing contacts from their professional or private sphere to identify a host, e. g. their professional or academic supervisors. More tips for finding a host are available on our website. Can I carry out my project with several hosts? Only one person can be your official host. But this does not mean that you are not permitted to also collaborate with other people during your project. Will my host receive any additional funds for the costs they incur in connection with my stay? To cover the additional costs of the stay in Germany, the host usually will receive a monthly allowance for research costs of €500. The Humboldt Foundation will transfer this money to a suitable account of the institution to which the host is affiliated. Is the German Chancellor Fellowship suitable for inhouse-trainings? No, the fellowship is not meant to support company employees who intend to work at German headquarters or branches. Applicants suggesting a project that includes an inhouse-training have a rather low chance of success. Preparation/Planning I would like to gain a doctorate. Can I apply with a dissertation project? The German Chancellor Fellowship is not a traditional doctoral fellowship programme. As a doctoral candidate you are however welcome to apply if: You have initial leadership experience beyond your research activities; Your project is relevant to the social dialogue; You will be able to successfully complete your project within the specified fellowship period. If you are interested in a traditional doctoral fellowship, we recommend applying to the German Academic Exchange Service (Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, DAAD) or other funding organisations. In case of doubt, please contact us (info[at]avh. de) before you apply so we can advise you. Can I apply to several Humboldt Foundation fellowship programmes at the same time if I fulfil the formal requirements? No, it is not possible to apply to several fellowship programmes concurrently. Should you be rejected by any of them, you may, however, apply to any other programme as long as you fulfil the formal requirements. Is the German Chancellor Fellowship suitable for gaining additional university degrees? No, a German Chancellor Fellowship is granted exclusively for the purpose of carrying out the project described in your application and agreed with your host. By accepting the fellowship the fellow commits him- or herself to the objective of the fellowship during the duration thereof. Can I conduct part of my project work abroad? During the sponsorship period, fellows may conduct short-term study or research visits to institutions elsewhere in Europe (except the fellows' home countries), if this is essential for the execution of the project. The maximum duration should be 1 to 2 months. Further information: stays in Europe. Are there deadlines for submitting applications? Yes. The application deadline is 15 Oktober of each year. How often do selection committee meetings take place? Selection meetings are held once a year in each programme country (Brazil, People's Republic of China, India, Russian Federation, South Africa, USA). The selection year is the year following the application. Do I need to have contacts in Germany at the time of application? Yes. In order to assess the feasibility of your project, the Selection Committee must know whether a mentor in Germany has agreed to provide appropriate supervision during your visit to Germany. Your host is required to submit a statement agreeing to support you in conducting your project. This confidential statement must be submitted together with the application documents; please draw your host's attention to the form for the confidential statement. Can I apply for a fellowship from another institution at the same time I submit my application to the Humboldt Foundation? In principle, it is possible to file parallel applications. You must, however, indicate this on the application form and inform us immediately of any other applications you submit and any other sponsorship decisions that occur while we are considering your application. Can the fellowship be postponed? No. Please also see the information provided below regarding the programme's time frame and the flexibility of the fellowship period. What is the time schedule of the programme? The German Chancellor Fellowship is intended as a one-year fellowship. If you are selected, you will be awarded twelve fellowship months, to start on 1 October of the selection year, and a three-month language fellowship to be taken up directly before the start of the German Chancellor Fellowship. The recommended standard timing is as follows: July to September of the selection year Intensive German language course immediately before the start of your fellowship: you attend an intensive language course in Bonn together with the other fellows of your year group. You will be expected to inform us of how many months of the awarded language fellowship you are willing and able to take up when you accept your German Chancellor Fellowship. 1 October You start your fellowship and begin to carry out your individual project at a host institute in Germany. November Joint opening conference in Bonn (lasting approx. one week) Spring Joint half-time conference (lasting approx. one week) Summer Three-day meeting in Berlin with visits to the Federal Chancellery and the Federal Foreign Office. 30 September Your fellowship ends Is it possible for me to plan my fellowship period in Germany more flexibly? Yes. You can use the awarded twelve fellowship months for stays in Germany within a time window from 1 August of the selection year to 31 March of the year after next, enabling you to flexibly adapt your months in Germany to suit the demands of the project, meet existing work obligations or allow for family circumstances. Do I have to state exactly how I will distribute my fellowship months when I apply? No. Please create a project plan covering twelve months in Germany for your application. If you are selected for a fellowship, you will be required to notify the Foundation of how you intend to distribute your fellowship months when you accept the fellowship. Please note that you must agree the scheduling of your visits to Germany with your host, and the duration of your visits must be planned in full months. We strongly recommend that you include the three joint programme events and a language fellowship in your intended schedule. I would like to come to Germany for less than twelve months. Can I apply anyway? No. The German Chancellor Fellowship aims to establish a vibrant, continuously expanding network of international decision-makers, multipliers and thought leaders who maintain lasting ties with Germany. The Foundation expects candidates to be open to conducting an extended stay in Germany and willing to plan a twelve-month project within a time window from 1 August of the selection year to 31 March of the year after next. Following a positive selection decision, you will be required to specify how you wish to distribute your fellowship period when you accept your fellowship. If it is apparent at that time that you will not be able to take advantage of the full twelve fellowship months due to professional or personal circumstances, you may submit an informal application to the Foundation to reduce the fellowship period in agreement with your host. Your altered schedule must include at least six months spent in Germany. When can I attend a language course? If you are awarded a fellowship, you will also be awarded a language fellowship to attend an intensive language course of up to three months if you do not yet speak German fluently. You will be required to choose the duration and scope of your language fellowship (one, two or three months) when you accept your fellowship. The language fellowship must take place directly before the start of your German Chancellor Fellowship and may not be interrupted. You may additionally apply for subsidies to cover the cost of evening classes during your fellowship. Please note the more comprehensive information on language fellowships and German language courses. Do I have to take part in a language course? You are not obliged to take a language course. If you do not yet speak German fluently we however strongly recommend that you take this opportunity. German language skills will help you integrate at the location of your host institute and enable you to participate in social and cultural life in Germany. In addition, selected programme items of the programme events are held (exclusively) in German. When can I attend joint events? The joint events of the German Chancellor Fellowship allow you to network with other fellows and gain insights into issues that are currently relevant in Germany. The three joint programme events of the German Chancellor Fellowship are: An opening conference in November (approx. one week) A half-time conference in the spring (approx. one week) A meeting in Berlin in July with a reception at the Federal Chancellery (three days). You will be notified of the exact dates if you are awarded a fellowship. These three events are important components of the fellowship and fundamental to the network of the German Chancellor Fellowship (for more information: Network and events for German Chancellor Fellows). You will have the opportunity to contribute your specific skills, support each other in small groups and independently organise further network activities. In addition, you will be invited to attend the annual meeting of the Humboldt Foundation and take part in a study tour together with fellows of other fellowship programmes. Do I have to attend the events? You are not obliged to attend the events. In order to make full use of the potential of the German Chancellor Fellowship and its network we however strongly recommend that you take part in the three joint programme events (opening conference, half-time conference, meeting in Berlin). Can I bring my family? The Humboldt Foundation welcomes the idea that fellows' partners and children should accompany them and encourages this by paying family allowances in addition to the fellowship, provided that the family members accompany the fellow for more than three months. Who bears the travel expenses to and from Germany? If the fellow's own institution does not cover travel expenses, the Humboldt Foundation will pay a single lump sum for return travel. The Humboldt Foundation will only pay travel expenses for family members in exceptional circumstances. The lump sum for travel expenses will only be paid once, even if you plan multiple partial stays. How high is the monthly grant I can expect if I am awarded a fellowship? The grant depends mainly on your academic and professional qualifications, position and professional experience, and may amount to €2,170, €2,470 or €2,770. In each case, this sum includes a flat-rate mobility fee and a subsidy to help meet healthcare and liability insurance costs. The level of the grant is determined by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. Examples of grants awarded to Federal Chancellor fellows: A fellow with a bachelor's degree in international relations, who graduated a year before the beginning of the fellowship; voluntary work and practicals with leading national and international political institutions while at university; since graduating, she has completed work experience placements at a national foundation and with a diplomatic mission of her home country abroad. Grant: €2,170. A fellow with a master's degree in communication and public relations, who graduated three years before the beginning of the fellowship; since graduating, he has gained professional experience as an employee at a public relations agency. Grant: €2,4570. A fellow with a law degree, who graduated five years before the beginning of the fellowship; after graduating, she gained professional experience first at a lawyer's office, then in a management role at a non-governmental organisation. Grant: €2,770. Application procedure How do I apply? You must apply online. If you wish to submit an application you must register first.

Members of the Selection Committee All the best for your application! Questions & Answers Application requirements Can I apply before I have completed my doctorate? You may apply if you will complete your doctorate within the next six months. If selected, you must complete your doctorate before commencing the research fellowship. Please note that your application will be rejected for formal reasons if your dissertation has not been published and you do not have any further academic publications at the time of application. What determines the date of a doctorate? The relevant date is that of completing the final academic part of the doctoral process (e. g. , defence of thesis, doctoral viva). This date will usually be included on your doctoral certificate alongside the date of issue. The key date for calculating the period following your doctorate is the date on which your application is received by the Humboldt Foundation. Which date is valid if I have several doctorates? In the case of multiple doctorates, the effective date is that of the first doctoral degree (PhD/CSc. ). My doctorate was completed less than four years ago. Can I apply for a fellowship for experienced researchers? Yes. You should, however, already have a clearly recognisable own research profile and, as a rule, be working at the level of at least assistant professor or junior research group leader, or have a record of several years of independent scientific work. My doctorate was completed more than four years ago. Can I apply for a fellowship for postdoctoral researchers? We cannot consider your application for a fellowship for postdoctoral researchers if your doctorate was completed more than four years ago. In case you already have a clearly recognisable own research profile and, as a rule working at the level of at least assistant professor or junior research group leader, or have a record of several years of independent scientific work, you can apply for a fellowship for experienced researchers. If you have passed the deadline, an exception may be made in well-founded cases (e. g. recognition of parental leave). Please send us your CV and a list of your publications before you apply so we can advise you (info[at]avh. de). I obtained my doctorate more than twelve years ago. Can I still apply for a fellowship for experienced researchers? We cannot consider your application if you obtained your doctorate more than twelve years ago. If you have missed the deadline, an exception may be made in well-founded cases (e. g. recognition of parental leave). Please send us your CV and a list of your publications before you apply so we can advise you (info[at]avh. de). How will child-rearing periods be considered in the application process? Periods in which you interrupted your academic activities after completing your doctorate in order to rear children may be taken into account as career breaks after examination. The proportionate offsetting of such periods is also possible. Please always indicate child-rearing periods when filling in our application form. Mothers can claim two extra years for each child born after their PhD plus any further verifiable parenting periods. Fathers and other persons responsible for raising children are only credited with verifiable parenting periods. In general, postdoctoral researchers may apply up to four years, and experienced researchers up to twelve years after completing their doctorates. Recognized child-rearing periods may correspondingly extend these maximum timeframes during which the submission of applications is possible. The extension is limited to 6 years. Please contact info[at]avh. de if you have any questions. Which other career breaks are considered in the application process? Periods in which you interrupted your academic activities after completing your doctorate in order to perform military or alternative service, to care for close relatives, due to long-term illness, or, for example, to care for children or due to the closure of institutes during a lockdown imposed to control an epidemic may be taken into account as career breaks after examination. The proportionate offsetting of such career breaks is also possible. Please always indicate career breaks when filling in our application form. Job hunting, unemployment and non-academic employment do not count as career breaks.

If you have only stayed in Germany up until this time for the purposes of your doctorate, or if you are integrated in a foreign science system, you are not eligible to apply. I'm a physician (MD / Dr. med. ). Are there any special admission requirements? You are eligible to apply if you hold a research doctorate or a comparable academic degree. In addition, please read our Admission Questionnaire for Physicians (MD / Dr. med. ) for detailed information. If you have several research doctorates, the above mentioned FAQ on the subject of ""several doctorates"" applies. Academic host Who can be my academic host? Any member of the Humboldt Network who is firmly established abroad may act as an academic host under the Feodor Lynen Research Fellowship Programme. These persons include: Any scientists or scholars who have been sponsored by the Humboldt Foundation, Any hosts who have already supervised scientists or scholars who were sponsored by the Humboldt Foundation, Any (former) members of a Humboldt Foundation selection committee, Any participants in the Frontiers of Research Symposia organised by the Humboldt Foundation. Scientists or scholars who have been granted a specified international academic award may also act as hosts. The Humboldt Foundation provides assistance with finding a host. You can search for hosts here. On request, we can inform you whether the host you have chosen is eligible to act as such. Can I collaborate with additional researchers within the framework of my planned research (in addition to my intended host)? The purpose of the Feodor Lynen Research Fellowship is to carry out research at a host institute abroad in cooperation with an academic host. Collaboration with other researchers at the intended host institute is possible at any time. If your planned research necessitates collaboration with researchers outside the intended host institute, the following applies: Such collaboration that in total exceeds 25 per cent of the fellowship period can only be carried out with an additional host. This person also has to be eligible to act as a host under the Feodor Lynen Research Fellowship Programme. In such cases, the Humboldt Foundation will need - already for the selection process - information regarding this host, an expert's statement, and confirmation from the proposed host that research facilities will be made available. Detailed information on who may act as a host can be found in the programme information for postdoctoral researchers or the programme information for experienced researchers. Further information can be found in our Guidelines and Advice for Feodor Lynen Research Fellows. What contribution is expected from the host? The Humboldt Foundation tries to involve the host in financing the research fellowship. For details please refer to the relevant programme information for postdoctoral and experienced academics. My host cannot make any financial contribution to the fellowship. Will you still consider my application? The Humboldt Foundation expects a contribution of the host to financing the research fellowship. Host institutions in developing and transition countries and in other selected countries (c. f. list of countries, PDF) are exempt from making a financial contribution to the fellowship. If host institutes in other countries experience obvious difficulties in raising their contribution, the Humboldt Foundation will try to accommodate cases of this kind. Preparation/Planning When and how often do Selection Committee Meetings take place? There are three Selection Committee Meetings each year: in February, June and October. Can I apply to several Humboldt Foundation fellowship programmes at the same time, or can I apply for a Humboldt Fellowship and the Sofja Kovalevskaja Award at the same time if I fulfil the formal requirements? No, it is not possible to apply to several fellowship programmes or the Sofja Kovalevskaja Award programme concurrently. Should you be rejected by any of them, you may, however, apply to any other programme as long as you fulfil the formal requirements. Can I apply for a research fellowship for a period of less than six months? The first research stay in the context of a postdoctoral fellowship must last at least six months. Experienced researchers must also apply for a stay of at least six months, which can, however, be divided up into two blocks of three months. I am a postdoctoral researcher. Can I divide up my research stay? It is not possible to break up the research stay. As an experienced researcher do I have to divide up my research stays strictly according to the model specified by the programme? Yes. It is not possible to deviate from the standard model. How soon can I begin the fellowship period? You can embark on your fellowship about two months after the selection committee has made its decision. When do I have to start the fellowship period at the latest? You must start the fellowship period within twelve months of being selected. Otherwise you will have to submit a new application. What is the amount of the fellowship? Please refer to our current programme information for details. Kindly understand that we cannot precalculate specific individual amounts prior to application. You may, however, consult our fellowship calculator. Will you pay the fellowship retroactively if I am already at the host institute at the time of being selected? No, the fellowship cannot be paid retroactively. Can I apply for a fellowship from another institution at the same time I submit my application to the Humboldt Foundation? On principle, it is possible to file parallel applications. You must, however, indicate this on the application form and inform us immediately of any other applications you submit and any other sponsorship decisions that occur while we are considering your application. Are there deadlines for submitting applications? There is no closing date for submitting applications. Applications are processed as part of an ongoing procedure. As soon as we have received your complete application we shall forward it to independent peer reviewers. Their written evaluations will then be presented to the selection committee at the next selection meeting at which a decision will be made. Please note that you can submit your application only after your host and your expert reviewers have uploaded all necessary documents. The date used to determine whether the applicant meets certain formal requirements, such as career stage limitations and stays in the host country, is the date on which the Humboldt Foundation receives the respective application. Selection Committee Meetings take place three times a year: in February, June and October. Applications should be submitted at least four to seven months ahead of the prospective selection meeting. A graphic display of the complete application process can be found under timeline of selection procedure. Application documents Should my expert reviews be sent directly to the Humboldt Foundation or enclosed with the application? Your host and expert reviewers upload the required documents in a secure area themselves, adding them to your application form. You can find the links to this area in the application form. Please send these links on a timely basis to your designated scientists/ academics. Once all the documents have been uploaded, you will automatically be notified by email and will then be able to submit your application. You are responsible for ensuring that your documents are complete. Expert reviews should not be more than 12 months old at the time of application. Who should provide an expert review for my application and how many reviews are required? The expert review should assess your development as a researcher, your potential, and your academic accomplishments to date. It is, therefore, important that expert reviewers are well acquainted with your academic work to date. You must submit two expert reviews. Postdocs must submit an expert review from their doctoral supervisor. Please note: The host's statement does not count as an expert review! You are responsible for requesting all expert reviews and the host's statement. Which publications should I submit with my application? Your application must contain one to five key publications (postdoctoral researchers: one to three key publications; experienced researchers: three to five key publications).

Your application will be reviewed by independent peer reviewers. Will I be notified of the reasons for a rejection? If your application is not approved, you may send an informal email requesting feedback to be sent to you and your host on the reasons for the rejection. This will usually follow approximately four to six weeks after the selection committee meeting. Please note that we cannot provide any personalised information before this juncture so as not to delay the notification process. Selection What are the most important selection criteria? The essential aspect of the application is the individual applicant's academic qualification. Please refer to the relevant programme information for more details on the selection criteria. Can I re-apply after being rejected? It is possible to re-apply. The new application should, however, differ significantly from the original, rejected application. Generally, it makes sense to re-apply after developing one's academic profile, e. g. after academical publications have been accepted by internationally reviewed journals and publishing houses. Our experience shows that applicants should wait about two years before re-applying. Submitting a new application that differs little or not at all from the rejected original may result in a formal rejection of the new application. This programme is financed by"

Will I be notified of the date the Selection Committee will decide on my application? When all the documents have been received we shall notify you about the proposed date of the selection meeting. Should the peer review process of your application take longer than expected you will also be informed if it becomes unavoidable to postpone the date of the decision. Who will review my application? Your application will be reviewed by independent peer reviewers. Will I be notified of the reasons for a rejection? If your application is not approved, you may send an informal email requesting feedback to be sent to you and your host on the reasons for the rejection. This will usually follow approximately four to six weeks after the selection committee meeting. Please note that we cannot provide any personalised information before this juncture so as not to delay the notification process. Selection What are the most important selection criteria? The essential aspect of the application is the individual applicant's academic qualification. Please refer to the relevant programme information for more details on the selection criteria. Can I re-apply after being rejected? It is possible to re-apply. The new application should, however, differ significantly from the original, rejected application. Generally, it makes sense to re-apply after developing one's academic profile, e. g. after academical publications have been accepted by internationally reviewed journals and publishing houses. Our experience shows that applicants should wait about two years before re-applying. Submitting a new application that differs little or not at all from the rejected original may result in a formal rejection of the new application. This programme is financed by"
"Register now and apply online or continue processing your application. Apply online Continue application Seeking networkers! Become a scout and recruit a Humboldt Research Fellow for your team and the Humboldt Network! Have you long since made a name for yourself in your discipline? Or are you at the beginning of a promising executive research career? Are you also well-connected internationally and have already mentored junior researchers? Then the Henriette Herz Scouting Programme could be the right one for you. We specifically want to recruit researchers as scouts who already have their own international network and would like to expand their team to include an excellent Humboldt Research Fellow. Two programme lines invite applications from both up-and-coming academics, who have only just become (junior) professors or group leaders, as well as established, experienced researchers. We particularly welcome applications from individuals who have not been connected with the Humboldt Foundation to date. If you are selected as a scout, you have the opportunity to recommend three research talents from abroad for a Humboldt Research Fellowship. After formal approval, the fellowships will be granted directly. We want to extend our network and make it more diverse. You should therefore set your sights on junior researchers who have not previously been considered for an application to the Humboldt Foundation or a research stay in Germany. Moreover, the first person you recommend should be a female researcher. Programme Information (PDF, 164 KB) Guidelines on the recommendation procedure (PDF, 128 KB) Guidelines on the ex-post evaluation (PDF, 111 KB) Recently selected scouts (November 2021) (PDF, 201 KB) Information for references Information for independent peer reviewers Individual advice: scouting[at]avh. de The Henriette Herz Scouting Programme comprises three phases: 1. Selection of scouts With your knowledge, connections and commitment you can scout particularly gifted scientific talents for Germany and your own institute. Every year, the Humboldt Foundation will select up to 40 scouts in a competitive peer-review process. You fulfil the following criteria The Henriette Herz Scouting Programme addresses researchers at different career stages in all disciplines in Germany. The requirement for becoming a scout is that you hold a (junior) professorship or equivalent executive position (e. g. group leader) in Germany. Scouts will be selected according to the following criteria: Visible academic success: you can substantiate your internationally recognised academic record, commensurate with your career level, by (initial) awards, outstanding publications, particularly innovative research or by approved research proposals Successful promotion of junior researchers' careers International connections: your extensive international collaborative network holds the potential to scout international research talents Convincing concept for identifying, selecting and hosting international researchers who have not applied to the Foundation to date How to apply You can submit an online application to become a scout on this website at any time. Two programme lines are available for: Up-and-coming researchers at an early career stage (within 15 years of completing your doctorate) Established researchers Please submit the following additional documents: A list of three selected key publications which substantiate your particularly innovative and excellent research A concept for identifying, selecting and hosting international junior researchers who would not themselves apply for a Humboldt Research Fellowship (approx. 1-2 pages) Two references: one from an international collaborative partner and one from a junior researcher you have supervised Your CV (2 pages max) In your concept, please outline in particular: The measures you intend to take to identify excellent junior researchers The (innovative) methods you want to use to recruit qualified researchers for your group, and how these (potentially) differ from previous efforts How you will go about recruiting suitable female researchers; please indicate how many of your permissions to recommend candidates would refer to women The role your own international network and your collaborations will play in the scouting campaign How you will organise the junior researcher's integration and mentoring The selection procedure Once your application documents have been checked, they will be forwarded to two independent peer reviewers who will provide written reviews based on the aforementioned selection criteria. An independent selection committee composed of researchers from all disciplines will select the best applications based on the peer reviews. The two programme lines will be discussed and decided upon separately in two groups. The selection committee meets twice a year, at the end of May and the end of November. 2. Granting of Humboldt Research Fellowships on recommendation of the scout As a scout in the Henriette Herz Scouting Programme, you will identify excellent junior researchers abroad. Your focus should be on researchers whose academic record qualifies them to be granted a Humboldt Research Fellowship but who have not yet taken part in the application process. This may be because many research talents have already secured a permanent job or lucrative offers from business or academia at an early stage in their careers, or simply do not have any contacts in Germany. The Humboldt Foundation is keen to increase diversity in the Humboldt Research Fellowship Programme, both in terms of subject and region; we also want to boost the percentage of women amongst our fellowship-recipients. Your first recommendation should, therefore, be for a female researcher. Every year, we want to grant up to 100 additional research fellowships in this way. The talents you are seeking The candidates you recommend must fulfil the following requirements: Doctorate completed within the last 12 years Above-average publication record, commensurate with career level Have not undertaken post-doctoral research stays nor completed degrees/doctorates in Germany Not hold German nationality Language skills: good knowledge of German or English, depending on research proposal Availability: the research fellowship should commence within 12 months of being granted No previous applications submitted to the Foundation by the candidate; no previous sponsorship in any of the Foundation's fellowship programmes For detailed information, visit our Guidelines on the Recommendation Procedure. General conditions We assume that scouts will make use of their recommendation permissions once a year. Other arrangements may be possible in agreement with the Foundation. You will find more information in the Guidelines on the Recommendation Procedure. Furthermore, when you have been selected as a scout, we will invite you to an information event. 3. Ex-post evaluation of the research fellows sponsored Was the sponsorship you initiated a success? When participating in the Henriette Herz Scouting Programme you and your research fellow will be expected to take part in an ex-post evaluation. The purpose of this procedure is to review the performance and results of the junior researchers sponsored in a peer-review process and facilitate comparability. Approximately a year after finishing the fellowship, we will ask independent peer reviewers to evaluate the results of the sponsorship based on your fellows' reports and your own assessment. Their evaluations will then be forwarded to the selection committee. If the outcome is positive you can re-apply for further permissions to scout fellows. For additional information visit the Guidelines on Ex-post Evaluation (PDF).

Can I apply for a fellowship anyway? The Humboldt Foundation underscores that applications from individuals who have not previously acted as hosts for the Humboldt Foundation are especially welcome. An applicaton is thus, if the other prerequisites are met, possible. Can I still apply if I work abroad? No, in order to apply, the applicant must hold an executive academic position at a German university or research institution at the time of applying. I am not a German national but I am a group leader at a German research institution. Can I apply? Yes, applicants that hold an executive academic position at a German university or research institution at the time of applying may apply. The applicant's nationality is not relevant in this case. Can I also apply for a fellowship programme of the Humboldt Foundation at the same time if I meet the relevant formal prerequisites? No, is it not possible to apply to several programmes of the Humboldt Foundation concurrently. I have previously received sponsorship through the Humboldt Foundation. Can I apply? Yes, if you hold an executive academic position at a German university or research institution at the time of applying and meet the other prerequisites. Preparing an application Are there any deadlines for submitting an application? There is no closing date for submitting your application. Applications are processed as part of an ongoing procedure. As soon as we receive your complete application, it will be forwarded to independent peer reviewers and, upon submission of the written peer review, a decision will be made at the next meeting of the Selection Committee. Please note that your application can only be submitted after your references have uploaded all the necessary documents. The date used to determine whether the applicant meets certain formal requirements, such as those relating to a permanent stay in Germany, is the date on which the Humboldt Foundation receives the respective application. Selection committee meetings take place twice a year - once in May and once in November. Applications should be submitted at least six to eight months ahead of the prospective selection meeting. Application documents Which aspects should the concept for identifying, selecting and supporting international junior researchers focus on? The concept is an integral part of the selection documents and will be uploaded with the application in the online portal. It should be comprised of about 2 pages. Points discussed in your concept should include: Measures to identify excellent junior researchers (Innovative) methods to recruit qualified resarchers for the team and how these, if so, differ from the methods applied in the past Plans to specifically identify and recruit female researchers, and targets for how many of the requested recommendation entitlements are to be awarded to women The role your own international networks and research cooperations will play in identifying and recruiting suitable candidates Planning for the involvement and support of junior researchers. Should the reference by the junior researcher be provided by the (post-)doctoral researcher currently being supervised or can it be provided by a previous junior researcher? This essentially addresses junior researchers who have been supervised in the past and could refer to either a doctoral candidate or a post-doctoral researcher. The person providing the reference should be in a position to answer the questions in the questionnaire (PDF). Selection procedure When will I be informed about the decision? We will inform you about the Selection Committee's decision via email in the days following the meeting. Recommendation procedure For what period of time are scouts selected? There is no standard duration for scouting activities; it depends on the granted permissions to recommend fellows and when they are used. Scouts can identify up to three potential research fellows abroad and recommend them for a Humboldt Research Fellowship. Ideally, scouts will use their permission to recommend a fellow once a year; in agreement with the Foundation, flexibility is possible. When a scout has been selected, he*she will be asked to provide the Foundation with information on the relevant plans at an early stage so that the budgetary resources can be made available. The appointment as a scout ends when the final research fellow's fellowship and the respective ex-post evaluation have been completed. Another application for further permissions to recommend fellows may then be submitted. How long will it be before a research fellow can begin his/her fellowship in my group? Documents are usually reviewed within two weeks and the grant documents are then issued within a further two weeks. When planning a research stay in Germany or the beginning of sponsorship, researchers from countries subject to visa requirements must take into account the duration of the respective visa process. Who was Henriette Herz? Henriette Julie Herz (* 5 September 1764 in Berlin; † 22 October 1847 in Berlin), Writer and host of first literary salon in Berlin Together with her husband, Henriette Herz organised discussion groups on scientific and philosophical topics. The participants, including the von Humboldt brothers, came from various strata of society. Henriette Herz stands for emancipation, networking and exchange as well as for the promotion of talents. She and Alexander von Humboldt shared a life-long friendship. Henriette Herz, née de Lemos, was born into a patrician family on 5 September 1764. Her father was a doctor and director of the Jewish Hospital in Berlin. Quite untypically for the time, he allowed his knowledge-hungry daughter to acquire a comprehensive education. From 1785, she held Prussia's first literary salon, inspiring many women to establish salons of their own. "

An independent Selection Committee will choose the fellowship recipients at this meeting. You may not apply if you have previously received funding from the Humboldt Foundation. All the best for your application! Questions & answers Application requirements I have worked in an English-speaking country for several years. Do I need an English language certificate? No, a language certificate is not required. Which completion date is valid if I hold multiple university degrees? In the case of multiple degrees, the valid date is the completion date of the first Bachelor's (or comparable) degree. What determines the completion date of my first university degree (Bachelor's or equivalent)? The relevant date is that of completing the final academic part of your first university degree (not the date of issue of your diploma certificate). The key date for calculating the period after your first university degree (Bachelor's or equivalent) is the application deadline of the ongoing selection round (1 February). I completed my first university degree (Bachelor's or equivalent) more than twelve years ago. Can I still apply? We cannot consider your application if you completed your first university degree (Bachelor's or equivalent) more than twelve years ago. The key date for calculating the period after your first university degree is the application deadline. If you have just passed the deadline, an exception may be made in well-founded cases (e. g. recognition of parental leave). Please send us your CV so we can advise you (info[at]avh. de). I do not yet possess sufficient professional experience in the field of climate protection or climate-related resource conservation. Can I still apply? In case you do not yet possess sufficient professional experience in the field of climate protection or climate-related resource conservation (at least 48 months at the time of application), you may still apply if you hold a further academic or professional degree in the above-mentioned fields at the time of application. You may apply for an International Climate Protection Fellowship for postdoctoral researchers if you hold a doctorate or comparable academic degree (Ph. D. , C. Sc. or equivalent) in the field of climate protection or climate-related resource conservation and completed your doctorate less than four years prior to the date of application (1 February). In case you are still in the process of completing your doctorate, you may apply if you will have completed it until 31 August of the selection year. How will child-rearing periods be considered in the application process? Periods in which you interrupted your professional activities or your further studies following your first academic degree (Bachelor's or equivalent) in order to rear children may be taken into account as career breaks after examination. The proportionate offsetting of such periods is also possible. Please always indicate child-rearing periods when filling in your application form. Mothers can claim two extra years for each child born after their first academic degree plus any further verifiable parenting periods. Fathers and other persons responsible for raising children are only credited with verifiable parenting periods. In general, you may apply if you completed your first academic degree (Bachelor's or equivalent) less than 12 years before the application deadline. Recognized child-rearing periods may correspondingly extend this maximum timeframe during which the submission of applications is possible. The extension is limited to 6 years. Please contact info[at]avh. de if you have any questions. Which other career breaks are considered in the application process? Periods in which you interrupted your professional activities or your further studies following your first academic degree (Bachelor's or equivalent) in order to perform military or alternative service, to care for close relatives, due to long-term illness or, for example, to care for children or due to the closure of institutes during a lockdown imposed to control an epidemic may be taken into account as career breaks after examination. The proportionate offsetting of such career breaks is also possible. Please always indicate career breaks when filling in your application form. Job hunting and unemployment do not count as career breaks. In general, you may apply if you completed your first academic degree (Bachelor's or equivalent) less than 12 years before the beginning of the fellowship. Recognized career breaks may correspondingly extend this maximum timeframe during which the submission of applications is possible. The extension is limited to 6 years. Please contact info[at]avh. de if you have any questions. Are child-rearing periods taken into account in the assessment of the previous career? Yes, because the assessment of the previous career is always made on an individual basis at the Humboldt Foundation. Therefore, when filling in the application form, please specify all periods in which you partially or completely interrupted your professional activities or your further studies following your first academic degree (Bachelor's or equivalent). The voluntary disclosure of private circumstances may help increase equal opportunities during the selection process. The consideration of your personal circumstances allows for a fairer assessment of your previous career. Please contact info[at]avh. de if you have any questions.

Can I apply even if I am not resident in a non-European developing country or a transition country (e. g. also Germany)? The aim of the programme is to enable prospective leaders working academically or practically from abroad to come to Germany to conduct a research stay here. Applicants should therefore be living and working in a non-European developing or transition country at the time of application (this also applies if contracted with institutions in Germany). Eligible applicants must have lived in an eligible country (list of countries, PDF) for a minimum of 12 months in the 18-month period prior to submission of the application. If in doubt, please contact us before you submit your application so we can advise you (info[at]avh. de). Can I apply if I completed my schooling and a university degree, or a university degree and a doctorate, in Germany? No, an application for an International Climate Protection Fellowship is not possible. If in doubt, send us a seamless CV so that we can then advise you (info[at]avh. de). Do I need to know German? Applicants must provide proof of their knowledge of German if this knowledge is necessary to ensure that the research-based proposal can be implemented successfully. Otherwise you must provide proof of good knowledge of English (language certificate required). Host Who can be my academic host? The academic host can be anyone who works at a public or private institution in Germany (university, research institute, public authority, non-governmental organization, ministry, company) and is able to agree that he or she will be your mentor during your proposed stay. In order to ensure that the host in Germany is able to act as mentor, he or she must have a professional relationship to the specialist area of your planned proposal and must be able to provide a workplace for you. In case the academic host is not authorized to provide a workplace, the host's confirmation of support has to be signed by his or her superior (e. g. executive director or director of the institute). How can I find a suitable host or host institution in Germany? You are free to choose your own academic host in Germany. The Humboldt Foundation does not provide any direct support in finding a host. You can, however, find information on our page Advice on finding a host or start your search for potential host institutions in Germany via the project data base of the German Federal Environmental Foundation, the GERiT - German Research Institutions, the Klimanavigator and the link list provided by the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research. What are my host's responsibilities? The host's main responsibility is to provide the right conditions for the successful completion of your proposal in Germany and to mediate the necessary contacts to other partners or institutions. The role of the host can vary depending on the requirements of your proposal and can range from regular contact to close collaboration. Can I implement my research-based proposal with two academic hosts? Of course you can cooperate with other partners, institutions etc. in Germany during your stay. You can however only have one official host. Applicants for the International Climate Fellowship Programme for postdoctoral researchers may carry out their projects with two hosts. If the hosts work at different research institutes, they must each provide a host's statement and confirmation that research facilities can be made available. Will my host receive any additional funds to cover the costs incurred in connection with my stay at the host institution? The host institution will receive an allowance amounting to 800 EUR per month for research-based proposals in the fields of natural sciences and engineering, and 500 EUR per month for proposals in the humanities or social sciences. Is the International Climate Protection Fellowship suitable for inhouse-trainings? No, the fellowship is not meant to support company employees who intend to work at German headquarters or branches. Applicants suggesting a project that includes an inhouse-training have a rather low chance of success. Preparation/Planning Can I apply to several Humboldt Foundation fellowship programmes at the same time, or can I apply for a Humboldt Fellowship and the Sofja Kovalevskaja Award at the same time if I fulfil the formal requirements? No, it is not possible to apply to several fellowship programmes or the Sofja Kovalevskaja Award programme concurrently. Should you be rejected by any of them, you may, however, apply to any other programme as long as you fulfil the formal requirements. Is the International Climate Protection Fellowship suitable for gaining additional university degrees or a Ph. D. ? No, the International Climate Protection Fellowship is awarded in order to implement the research-based proposal, which has been chosen by the fellow and agreed upon with the host. It neither aims at pursuing (partly) a Ph. D. degree. By accepting the fellowship the fellow commits him- or herself to the objective of the fellowship during the duration thereof. Can I conduct part of my research-based work abroad? During the sponsorship period, fellows may conduct short-term research visits to institutions in other European countries if this is necessary to implement the research-based proposal successfully. The maximum duration should be 1 to 2 months. Further information: Europe research stays. You may plan a Europe research stay already in your research-based proposal when applying; however, you may apply for it only after having been awarded a fellowship. It is not possible to apply for a research visit to your home country or a country outside Europe during the fellowship; as a rule, the fellowship then has to be interrupted for this period or the research visit abroad has to be realized prior to the beginning of the fellowship. Who bears the travel expenses to and from Germany? If the fellow's own institution does not cover travel expenses, the Humboldt Foundation will pay a single lump sum for return travel. The Humboldt Foundation will only pay travel expenses for family members in exceptional circumstances. Can I apply for a fellowship from another institution at the same time I submit my application to the Humboldt Foundation? In principle, it is possible to file parallel applications. You must, however, indicate this on the application form and inform us immediately of any other applications you submit and any other sponsorship decisions that occur while we are considering your application. Are there deadlines for submitting applications? Yes. The complete application package must be received by 1 February. How often do selection rounds take place? There is one Selection Meeting per year. The Humboldt Foundation will pay a travel allowance and provide accommodation and meals for the duration of the meeting. What is the value of the fellowship? Please refer to our current programme informations: International Climate Protection Fellowships (PDF) International Climate Protection Fellowships for Postdoctoral Researchers (PDF) What is the timetable for the fellowship? The fellowship enables prospective leaders working practically to spend a year in Germany to implement a research-based proposal and postdoctoral researchers to implement long-term research proposals (12-24 months) at a German host institution. The following timetable is mandatory for all fellows: January - February 2023: Intensive German course in Germany (optional) March 2023: three-week introductory seminar at several locations in Germany April 2023 - February 2024: Work on individual proposals June 2023: Annual Meeting of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, including reception by the Federal President of Germany Autumn 2023: Two-week study tour through Germany January/February 2024: final week, including reception in the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection For postdoctoral researchers afterwards: continuation of the research proposal for the period applied for, individual trainings and participation in programme events of the Foundation (optional) When can I take part in a language course? The intensive German course can only be taken immediately prior to the start of the fellowship. Do I have to take part in a language course? There is no obligation to take part in a language course. The Humboldt Foundation strongly recommends that all fellows who know little or no German participate in the two-month intensive language course. Can the fellowship be postponed? No. The fellowship must be taken up in accordance with the programme timetable. Can I bring my family? The Humboldt Foundation welcomes the idea that fellows´ partners and children should accompany them and encourages this by paying family allowances in addition to the fellowship, provided that the family members accompany the fellow for more than three months. Application documents What information should the letter of motivation contain? Your letter of motivation should contain information about your relevant personal and professional qualifications as relating to the fellowship. It should further describe the personal and professional goals you wish to pursue with the fellowship. What information should the research-based proposal contain? The proposal must contain the following information: subject, methods, aims and bibliography of the planned proposal. You are further requested to draw up a schedule including milestones for the funding period. You must independently draw up this schedule and agree it with your intended host in Germany before submitting your application. Please also explain what results you expect and how these are relevant to climate change (in terms of reducing emissions, adapting to climate change and conserving of biodiversity in a changing climate). We also ask that you outline how you intend to publish the results of your proposal during and after your fellowship, and what target groups you particularly plan to address. Who must provide letters of recommendation for my application and how many references are required? Please request letters of recommendation from two people who can give well-founded accounts of your professional, academic and personal background as well as your leadership skills, e. g. your current supervisor / mentor previous supervisors / mentors Applicants for International Climate Protection Fellowships for postdoctoral researchers should ask for an expert review written by their doctoral supervisor. The second letter of recommendation should preferably be written by a reviewer not working at the applicant's own institute. Please note: The host's statement is not considered a letter of recommendation! Can I apply after the official closing date for applications? After the respective closing date it is unfortunately not possible anymore to submit an application online. In this programme applications by email, post or fax are not permitted. How often can I submit an application online? You can only submit your application once. It is, however, possible to save your application and return to it as often as you like prior to submission. Please note, however, that your complete application must reach the Humboldt Foundation by the closing date at the latest. Incomplete applications may be excluded from the respective selection round. Who should send the host's statement to the Humboldt Foundation? The host uploads his/her statement as well as the confirmation of support in a secure area of our online platform, adding them to your application form. You can find the link to this area in the application form. Please send this link on a timely basis to the designated person. Once all the documents have been uploaded, you will automatically be notified by email and will then be able to submit your application. You are responsible for ensuring that your documents are complete. Please draw your host's attention to our list of questions for the host's statement (PDF) and the required confirmation of support. Should my expert reviews be sent directly to the Humboldt Foundation or enclosed with the application? Your expert reviewers upload the required documents in a secure area of our online platform, adding them to your application form. You can find the links to this area in the application form. Please send these links on a timely basis to the designated persons. Once all the documents have been uploaded, you will automatically be notified by email and will then be able to submit your application. You are responsible for ensuring that your documents are complete. Expert reviews should not be more than 12 months old at the time of application. Do my certificates have to be officially certified? Certificates in German, English, French, Latin, Spanish or Italian do not need to be certified. If your documents are in any other language, you must provide certified translations. A translation agency, for example, can assist you with certified translations. Further information for applicants holding a PhD or currently doing a PhD Can I apply before I have completed my doctorate? You may apply if you will complete your doctorate until 31 August of the respective selection year or if you have completed it less than four years prior to the date of application. At the same time your first university degree (Bachelor's or equivalent) must have been completed less than 12 years previously. Sponsorship during the doctorate is, however, not possible. What determines the date of a doctorate? The relevant date is that of completing the final academic part of the doctoral process (e. g. , defence of thesis, doctoral viva). This date will usually be included on your doctoral certificate alongside the date of issue. The key date for calculating the period following your doctorate is the date on which your application is received by the Humboldt Foundation. My doctorate was completed more than four years ago. Can I apply for a fellowship for postdoctoral researchers? If you have passed the deadline, an exception may be made in well-founded cases (e. g. recognition of parental leave). Periods in which you interrupted your professional or scientific activities following your doctorate in order to rear children may be taken into account as career breaks after examination. The proportionate offsetting of such periods is also possible. Please always indicate child-rearing periods when filling in your application form. Mothers can claim two extra years for each child born after their doctorate plus any further verifiable parenting periods. Fathers and other persons responsible for raising children are only credited with verifiable parenting periods. Please consider also our FAQ ""How will child-rearing periods be considered in the application process?"" explaining the 12-years-limit for the completion of your first academic degree (Bachelor's or equivalent). Please send us your CV and a list of your publications before you apply so we can advise you (info[at]avh. de). I already have a doctorate or am in the process of doing one. Should I apply to the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation for an International Climate Protection Fellowship or a Research Fellowship? The International Climate Protection Fellowship programme is aimed at prospective leaders who are active in the field of climate protection and climate-related resource conservation either in academic or practice-oriented work in their countries of origin. The programme is structured according to a fixed schedule including training components (see ""What is the timetable of the fellowship?""). The Humboldt Research Fellowship programme is more suitable for basic research, while the Georg Forster Research Fellowship programme is targeted at academics from developing and transition countries wishing to conduct research with relevance to development. In case of doubt, please contact us for advice before submitting an application (info[at]avh. de). Which publications should I enclose with my application? Your application must contain one to three key publications. Other publications will not be accepted (exception: You may optionally submit published reviews of your key publications by other authors). If you wish to cite your dissertation as a key publication but have not yet submitted it for printing, please upload the original manuscript of your doctoral thesis. Before uploading, please check the accuracy of the information provided in your publication lists (complete list, list of key publications), in particular with regard to the order and completeness of the information on the authors, the titles of the publications and the publication venues. Inaccurate information could lead to the rejection of your application on formal grounds. May I include works that have not yet been submitted for publication in the list of key publications and the complete list of publications? No. Please only cite publications that are already in print, have been accepted for publication or have at least been submitted to a publishing house. Please cite submitted publications without naming the journal or publishing house on your publication list. In the latter case you must include the acknowledgement of receipt from the publisher; in case of publications that have been accepted, please include the letter of acceptance from the publisher. Any other works cited on the list will be deleted. Exception: Your dissertation may be cited as a key publication even if you have not yet submitted it to a publisher. If you wish to cite your dissertation as a key publication but have not yet submitted it for printing, please upload the original manuscript of your doctoral thesis. What are key publications? You yourself should choose the key publications from your publications. You should choose works which present your most important academic results. In cases of multiple authorship you should select those to which you have made a major contribution. When choosing key publications we recommend including works that reflect your more recent publication activity. Please note that you cannot amend your selection of key publications once the selection process has begun. How many key publications should I cite? If you are already holding or currently doing a PhD, you have to choose at least one key publication. You may cite a maximum of three. Surplus key publications will be removed from the list without notifying the applicant. How should I explain why I have chosen a key publication? Please"

The decision will be based on the documents you submit, the host's statement and, usually, two independent peer reviews requested by Capes and the Humboldt Foundation. In past years, on average, 20 to 25 per cent of applicants have received a fellowship. All the best for your application! Questions and answers Application requirements Do I need an English language certificate? No, an English language certificate is not required. What determines the date of a doctorate? The relevant date is that of completing the final academic part of the doctoral process (e. g. , defence of thesis, doctoral viva). This date will usually be included on your doctoral certificate alongside the date of issue. The key date for calculating the period following your doctorate is the date on which your application is received by the Humboldt Foundation. Which date is valid if I have several doctorates? In the case of multiple doctorates, the effective date is that of the first doctoral degree (PhD/CSc. ). My doctorate was completed less than four years ago. Can I apply for a fellowship for experienced researchers? Yes. You should, however, already have a clearly recognisable own research profile and, as a rule, be working at the level of at least assistant professor or junior research group leader, or have a record of several years of independent scientific work. My doctorate was completed more than four years ago. Can I apply for a fellowship for postdoctoral researchers? We cannot consider your application for a fellowship for postdoctoral researchers if your doctorate was completed more than four years ago. In case you already have a clearly recognisable own research profile and, as a rule, working at the level of at least assistant professor or junior research group leader, or have a record of several years of independent scientific work, you can apply for a fellowship for experienced researchers. If you have passed the deadline, an exception may be made in well-founded cases (e. g. recognition of parental leave). I obtained my doctorate more than twelve years ago. Can I still apply for a fellowship for experienced researchers? We cannot consider your application if you obtained your doctorate more than twelve years ago. If you have missed the deadline, an exception may be made in well-founded cases (e. g. recognition of parental leave). How will child-rearing periods be considered in the application process? Periods in which you interrupted your academic activities after completing your doctorate in order to rear children may be taken into account as career breaks after examination. The proportionate offsetting of such periods is also possible. A maximum of two years may be claimed per child. Please always indicate child-rearing periods when filling in our application form. Mothers can claim two extra years for each child born after their PhD plus any further verifiable parenting periods. Fathers and other persons responsible for raising children are only credited with verifiable parenting periods. In general, postdoctoral researchers may apply up to four years, and experienced researchers up to twelve years after completing their doctorates. Recognized child-rearing periods may correspondingly extend these maximum timeframes during which the submission of applications is possible. The extension is limited to 6 years. Please contact info[at]avh. de if you have any questions. Are child-rearing periods taken into account in the assessment of academic achievements? Yes, because the assessment of academic achievements is always made on an individual basis at the Humboldt Foundation. Therefore, when filling in the application form, please specify all periods in which you partially or completely interrupted your academic activities after finishing your doctorate in order to rear children. The voluntary disclosure of private circumstances may help increase equal opportunities during the selection process. The consideration of your personal circumstances allows for a fairer assessment of your academic achievements. Please contact info[at]avh. de if you have any questions. Do I need to know German in order to apply? Natural scientists and engineers: good knowledge of German or English is sufficient. Scholars in the humanities and social sciences: should have knowledge of German if it is necessary to carry out the research successfully. In this case, a German language certificate confirming proficiency must be submitted. Otherwise, a good knowledge of English is sufficient. Physicians: If the research involves work with patients, the candidate must have a good knowledge of German (language certificate required). Otherwise, a good knowledge of English is sufficient. English or German is my native language. Do I have to submit a language certificate proving my proficiency? No, a language certificate is not required. I'm a physician (MD / Dr. med. ). Are there any special admission requirements? You are eligible to apply if you hold a research doctorate or a comparable academic degree. In addition, please read our Admission Questionnaire for Physicians (MD / Dr. med. ) for detailed information. If you have several research doctorates, the above mentioned FAQ on the subject of ""several doctorates"" applies. I already am or recently have been in Germany. Are there any formal grounds militating against my application? Applicants must reside in Brazil at the time of application. If you have previously been to Germany, you may only apply if you have resided outside Germany for a minimum of 12 months in total in the 18-month period prior to submission of the application. Any time spent in Germany within those 18 months is taken into account, regardless of duration or reason. This also applies to employment contracts with institutions in Germany. German citizens and/or educational residents* (see following FAQ) are generally ineligible to apply if they have been in Germany within the last 18 months prior to receipt of their application or are already in Germany at the time of applying. Can I apply from abroad as a German citizen/educational resident? The aim of the programme is to enable highly qualified academics from abroad to come to Germany to conduct a research stay here. German citizens/educational residents are thus not the target group of this funding programme (Educational residents are individuals who have completed their school education and a university degree, or a university degree and their doctorate in Germany). You are however eligible to apply if you are permanently working in Brazil and intend to return to Brazil immediately following the requested research stay. We consider these preconditions as fulfilled if your habitual place of work and residence has been located in Brazil on the assumption of permanence for at least five years and if in addition you either have: a. Brazilian nationality and/or b. Permanent residence visa in Brazil If you intend to apply in order to prepare your permanent return to Germany, we recommend that you instead apply to the ""Temporary Positions"" programme of the DFG. If in doubt, we would ask to send us only your complete CV and a list of your publications, so that we can advise you (info[at]avh. de). Academic host Who can be my academic host? Any researcher working at a university or research institution in Germany who offers to make research facilities available for the proposed research stay. How can I find an academic host? You are free to choose your own academic host. The Humboldt Foundation does not provide any direct support in finding a host. We would like to draw your attention to the following search engines for hosts and research institutes: Institutes at German universities and other research institutions Searchable Portal (GERiT) of the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) Research facilities, disciplines and research in Germany Research portal of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) Research Map Hochschulrektorenkonferenz (HRK) Research facilities, researchers and projects of the DFG in Germany and worldwide GEPRIS - Database of the German Research Foundation Research facilities, disciplines and researchers in Germany and worldwide World of Learning KISSWIN Communication and information platform on career paths and funding opportunities for junior academics We would also like to draw your attention to the open access part of the Network Online. This database features a large proportion of the Foundation's more than 25,000 academics sponsored worldwide. Here you can search for names, disciplines and keywords. Can I conduct my research stay with two academic hosts? Yes. If the hosts work at different research institutes, they must each provide a host's statement and confirmation that research facilities can be made available. Will my host institute receive any additional funds for the costs it incurs in connection with my research stay? In general the host institute will receive an allowance for research costs of €800 per month for research in the field of natural sciences and engineering, and €500 for research in the field of humanities or social sciences. Preparation/Planning Can I apply to several Humboldt Foundation fellowship programmes at the same time, or can I apply for a Humboldt Fellowship and the Sofja Kovalevskaja Award at the same time if I fulfil the formal requirements? No, it is not possible to apply to several fellowship programmes or the Sofja Kovalevskaja Award Programme concurrently. Should you be rejected by any of them, you may, however, apply to any other programme as long as you fulfil the formal requirements. Can I apply for a fellowship from another institution at the same time I submit my application to the Humboldt Foundation? On principle, it is possible to file parallel applications. You must, however, indicate this on the application form and inform us immediately of any other applications you submit and any other sponsorship decisions that occur while we are considering your application. Can I conduct part of my research work abroad? If it is necessary for the success of the project, fellows may conduct research at research institutions in other parts of Europe during the fellowship period (excepting their country of origin). Please do not apply for this stay until you have been awarded the fellowship. As a rule, the total length of your Europe Research Stay may not exceed 25 per cent of the projected total duration of sponsorship. Furthermore, if the fellowship is divided up into several stays (experienced researchers), the duration of the Europe Research Stay may on principle not exceed half the duration of the respective fellowship period. Research stays in the fellow's country of origin or in a non-European country will, however, normally result in a temporary suspension of the fellowship. Can I apply for a research fellowship for a period of less than six months? The first research stay in the context of a postdoctoral fellowship must last at least six months. Experienced researchers must also apply for a stay of at least six months, which can, however, be divided up into two blocks of three months. I am a postdoctoral researcher. Can I divide up my research stay? It is not possible to break up the research stay. Do I have to divide up my research stays strictly according to the model specified by the programme line for experienced researchers? Yes. It is not possible to deviate from the standard model. When do I have to start the fellowship period at the latest? You must start the fellowship period within twelve months of being selected. Otherwise you will have to submit a new application. What is the value of the fellowship? Please refer to our current programme information for postdoctoral and experienced researchers. Will you pay the fellowship retroactively if I am already at the host institute at the time of being selected? No, the fellowship cannot be paid retroactively. Is the intensive German language course part of my research fellowship? A two- to four-month language course takes place immediately prior to the start of the research fellowship. The language fellowship is not part of the research fellowship. (In other words, if you apply for a two-month language course in connection with a 12-month research stay in Germany, your stay will last a total of 14 months. ) When can I attend a language course? The intensive German language course can only be taken immediately prior to the start of the research fellowship. If this is not possible, you may apply for funds to attend evening classes during the research fellowship. Do I have to take a language course? There is no obligation to take a language course. However, the Humboldt Foundation strongly encourages all its fellows and their partners to learn German during their research stay so that they can fully participate in social and cultural life in Germany. Can I bring my family? The Humboldt Foundation welcomes the idea that fellows' partners and children should accompany them and encourages this by paying family allowances in addition to the fellowship, provided that the family members accompany the fellow for more than three months. Application documents Should I submit my application documents directly to both organisations? Yes, please submit two identical sets of your complete application documents - one to Capes and one to the Humboldt Foundation - in a timely fashion. Please notice that the host documents have to be submitted only to the Humboldt Foundation. Your host(s) will upload the required documents in a secure area, adding them to your application form. The links to this area can be found in the application form. Please send these links on a timely basis to the scientists/ academics you have named. Once all the documents have been uploaded, you will automatically be notified by email and will then be able to submit your application. You are responsible for ensuring that your documents are complete. Which publications should I enclose with my application? Your application must contain one copy of each of the key publications you have chosen. Other publications will not be accepted (exception: You may optionally submit published reviews of your key publications by other authors). If you wish to cite your dissertation as a key publication but have not yet submitted it for printing, please upload the original manuscript of your doctoral thesis. May I include works that have not yet been submitted for publication in the list of key publications and the complete list of publications? No. Please only cite publications that are already in print, have been accepted for publication or have at least been submitted to a publishing house. Please cite submitted publications without naming the journal or publishing house on your publication list. In the latter case you must include the acknowledgement of receipt from the publisher; in case of publications that have been accepted, please include the letter of acceptance from the publisher. Any other works cited on the list will be deleted. Exception: Your dissertation may be cited as a key publication even if you have not yet submitted it to a publisher. If you wish to cite your dissertation as a key publication but have not yet submitted it for printing, please upload the original manuscript of your doctoral thesis. What are key publications? You yourself should choose the key publications from your publications. You should choose works which present your most important academic results. In cases of multiple authorship you should select those to which you have made a major contribution. When choosing key publications we recommend including works that reflect your more recent publication activity. Please note that you cannot amend your selection of key publications once the selection process has begun. How many key publications should I cite? If you are applying for a fellowship for postdoctoral researchers, one key publication is sufficient. You may cite a maximum of three. If you are applying for a fellowship for experienced researchers you must choose at least three key publications. You may cite a maximum of five. Surplus key publications will be removed from the list without notifying the applicant. How should I explain why I have chosen a key publication? Please address the particular academic relevance of the results contained in the key publication and briefly explain the significance of the publication for your academic profile (cf. Sample key publications, PDF). In cases of multiple authorship please also indicate your own personal contribution to the publication. Should my key publications also be cited in the complete list of publications? Yes. Please cite all your publications in the complete list of publications, including your key publications. An unpublished dissertation, however, may not be listed in the complete list of publications. In this list the key publications should be cited without explanations (cf. Sample publication list, PDF). Please note that the order of the authors on the publication list corresponds to the order of the authors on the submitted publication. Changing the order is against the Rules of Good Scientific Practice (PDF) and may result in penalties. Please note that it is not possible to amend the list of publications submitted once the selection process has begun. Selection procedure Who will review my application? Your application will be reviewed by independent peer reviewers. Who will decide on my application? The final decision on all applications is made by the Selection Committee. The Selection Committee consists of researchers of all disciplines who decide on all applications by majority vote. The Humboldt Foundation and Capes have no vote on the Selection Committee. Selection How high is the success rate? In recent years, between 20% and 25% of all applications have been successful. What are the most important selection criteria? The essential aspect of the application is the individual applicant's academic qualification. Please refer to the relevant programme information for more details on the selection criteria. Can I re-apply after being rejected? It is possible to re-apply if you fulfil the eligibility criteria. The new application should, however, differ significantly from the original, rejected application. Generally, it makes sense to re-apply after developing one's academic profile, e. g. after academical publications have been accepted by internationally reviewed journals and publishing houses. Our experience shows that applicants should wait about two years before re-applying. Submitting a new application that differs little or not at all from the rejected original may result in a formal rejection of the new application. In the case of unanimously rejected applications, a new application will be accepted only after 3 calls. What issues frequently result in applications being rejected? Insufficient publication record: In particular, applicants who apply shortly afterupon completion of their doctoral thesis should ensure that the key findings of the doctoral thesis (key publications) are already published or have been accepted for publication. In case of doubt, it is a good idea to wait for several months before submitting the application until evidence can be provided that the key publications have been accepted. Lack of academic development: The chosen research project should not be a direct continuation of the doctoral thesis or of the academic work carried out to date. Returning to the same academic environment, e. g. returning to the supervisor of the doctoral thesis or the mentor of longer postdoctoral research (more than 12 months), or returning to a host institute where a longer research stay has already taken place, generally results in the rejection of applications on the basis of a lack of further independent academic development. Lack of originality: In the qualitative assessment of the key publications and of the research outline, the independent peer reviewers focus in particular on the originality of the work and the associated impetus for further development in this research area. If these aspects are not immediately apparent, if the research concerns more routine work or if the aims of the planned research and its significance for the continued development of the subject area are not clearly presented, applications are generally rejected. Lack of personal academic profile, academic establishment: In the experienced academics' programme segment, the personal academic profile is of major importance for the assessment of applications by the independent peer reviewers and committee members. Therefore, applications are frequently rejected if no or insufficient publications are available in sole authorship or as a corresponding author; the applicants' topics are too narrowly focused; no clear continued academic development is apparent; the research project is not clearly aligned with the research interests of the applicant; after several postdoctoral positions, another ""traditional"" postdoctoral position is applied for without the applicant becoming independently established academically in the meantime. For experienced academics whose doctorate was completed more than eight years ago, rejection often results if a position as an independent academic (assistant professor, lecturer, junior research group leader, etc. ) has still not been obtained, or if the prospect of a professorial appointment upon completion of the proposed stay is not apparent from the documentation submitted, especially the publication profile.

All the best for your application! Questions & answers Application requirements I have worked in an English-speaking country for several years. Do I need an English language certificate? No, an English language certificate is not required. Can I apply before I have completed my doctorate? You may apply if you will complete your doctorate within the next six months. If selected, you must complete your doctorate before commencing the research fellowship. Please note that your application will be rejected for formal reasons if your dissertation has not been published and you do not have any further academic publications at the time of application. It is either not customary or not possible to take a doctorate in my country of origin. Can I apply? You can apply if you can prove that your academic performance is equivalent to a Ph. D. , e. g. by academic publications in internationally reviewed journals and publishing houses. Should this be the case, you may apply to the programme for experienced researchers, however, only until up to 16 years after you obtained your first university degree (Master's degree, Diploma, etc. ). It is, furthermore, possible to apply to the programme for experienced researchers if you hold an academic position that is equivalent to or higher than Associate Professor / Senior Lecturer / Reader etc. , regardless of the date of your first university degree, within the first twelve years of working in this position. Please send us your CV and a list of your publications before you apply so we can advise you (info[at]avh. de). What determines the date of a doctorate? The relevant date is that of completing the final academic part of the doctoral process (e. g. , defence of thesis, doctoral viva). This date will usually be included on your doctoral certificate alongside the date of issue. The key date for calculating the period following your doctorate is the date on which your application is received by the Humboldt Foundation. Which date is valid if I have several doctorates? In the case of multiple doctorates, the effective date is that of the first doctoral degree (PhD/CSc. ). My doctorate was completed less than four years ago. Can I apply for a fellowship for experienced researchers? Yes. You should, however, already have a clearly recognisable own research profile and, as a rule, be working at the level of at least assistant professor or junior research group leader, or have a record of several years of independent scientific work. My doctorate was completed more than four years ago. Can I apply for a fellowship for postdoctoral researchers? We cannot consider your application for a fellowship for postdoctoral researchers if your doctorate was completed more than four years ago. In case you already have a clearly recognisable own research profile and, as a rule, are working at the level of at least assistant professor or junior research group leader, or have a record of several years of independent scientific work, you can apply for a fellowship for experienced researchers. If you have passed the deadline, an exception may be made in well-founded cases (e. g. recognition of parental leave). Please send us your CV and a list of your publications before you apply so we can advise you (info[at]avh. de). I obtained my doctorate more than twelve years ago. Can I still apply for a fellowship for experienced researchers? We cannot consider your application if you obtained your doctorate more than twelve years ago. If you have missed the deadline, an exception may be made in well-founded cases (e. g. recognition of parental leave). Please send us your CV and a list of your publications before you apply so we can advise you (info[at]avh. de). How will child-rearing periods be considered in the application process? Periods in which you interrupted your academic activities after completing your doctorate in order to rear children may be taken into account as career breaks after examination. The proportionate offsetting of such periods is also possible. Please always indicate child-rearing periods when filling in our application form. Mothers can claim two extra years for each child born after their PhD plus any further verifiable parenting periods. Fathers and other persons responsible for raising children are only credited with verifiable parenting periods. In general, postdoctoral researchers may apply up to four years, and experienced researchers up to twelve years after completing their doctorates. Recognized child-rearing periods may correspondingly extend these maximum timeframes during which the submission of applications is possible. The extension is limited to 6 years. Please contact info[at]avh. de if you have any questions. Which other career breaks are considered in the application process? Periods in which you interrupted your academic activities after completing your doctorate in order to perform military or alternative service, to care for close relatives, due to long-term illness, or, for example, to care for children or due to the closure of institutes during a lockdown imposed to control an epidemic may be taken into account as career breaks after examination. The proportionate offsetting of such career breaks is also possible. Please always indicate career breaks when filling in our application form. Job hunting, unemployment and non-academic employment do not count as career breaks. In general, postdoctoral researchers may apply up to four years, and experienced researchers up to twelve years after completing their doctorates. Recognized career breaks may correspondingly extend these maximum timeframes during which the submission of applications is possible. The extension is limited to 6 years. Please contact info[at]avh. de if you have any questions. Are child-rearing periods taken into account in the assessment of academic achievements? Yes, because the assessment of academic achievements is always made on an individual basis at the Humboldt Foundation. Therefore, when filling in the application form, please specify all periods in which you partially or completely interrupted your academic activities after finishing your doctorate in order to rear children. The voluntary disclosure of private circumstances may help increase equal opportunities during the selection process. The consideration of your personal circumstances allows for a fairer assessment of your academic achievements. Please contact info[at]avh. de if you have any questions.

I am from a developing/transition country. Should I apply for a Humboldt or Georg Forster Research Fellowship? If your primary life focus (nationality and permanent residence) is in a developing or transition country (see list of countries) and your research is of relevance for that country's (or region's) further development (see examples below), we recommend that you apply for a George Forster Research Fellowship. A persuasive presentation of your work's relevance for development in your region is one of the key criteria used when your application is evaluated. For projects that would be classified as basic research, we recommend applying for a Humboldt Research Fellowship. Examples of applications with relevance to development: Example 1: Food security among children in Nigeria Foodstuffs that are contaminated with mycotoxins, the toxic metabolic substances produced by fungi, present a challenge for the people of Nigeria. As part of a Georg Forster Research Fellowship, one Humboldtian examined with the help of biomonitoring the degree to which Nigerian children and adolescents are exposed to mycotoxins in foodstuffs. In this way she is striving to improve the food safety of the Nigerian people. Example 2: Climate change and stressed plants Plants emit a number of volatile organic compounds in response to heat and drought stress. During her guest visit in Germany, a Latin American Humboldtian studied the impact these emissions have on air quality and changes in the climate. Her findings were used to develop sustainable adaptation and mitigation strategies tailored to the region she comes from. These findings offer political stakeholders a scientifically proven basis for making decisions. Example 3: Improved tax enforcement through international co-operation Audits are a tried and tested tool in the fight against tax evasion. In the case of transnational audits, joint tax audits can be conducted by international teams. During her Georg Forster research stay in Germany, one Humboldtian examined the advantages of joint tax audits with the aim of formulating recommendations for action to develop and improve international tax law. By doing so, the Moldavian hopes to make a contribution to her country's integration into international tax law structures. Example 4: Water reservoirs Siltation of water reservoirs is a major problem for Iran's water supply. One Iranian Humboldtian dedicated his stay in Germany to working on methods to reduce sedimentation in water bodies which he can now transfer to his country of origin thanks to his existing contacts and good local connections. Example 5: Resource use A Burmese Humboldtian focused on the extraction of mineral resources in Myanmar. Thanks to his Georg Forster Fellowship he was able to expand his raw materials expertise as one of the only few excellent Burmese economic geologists. He is now making valuable contributions to the geoscience community in his country of origin and is advancing sustainable resource development and use there. The following examples were not accepted by the Georg Forster Fellowship Programme because they have little relevance to development: Example 1: Researching neurodegenerative diseases Worldwide neurodegenerative diseases pose an enormous problem for people suffering from them. Studying and designing possible treatment methods for such diseases requires costly equipment. One applicant planned to increase his knowledge of this type of technology and how to use it. It was not, however, apparent from his application how the skills he aimed to acquire in Germany could be put to practical use without having corresponding infrastructure in his native country. Example 2: Further development of cosmological models One applicant sought to further develop cosmological models (theoretical physics) with her research project. She convincingly demonstrated that the project would offer added value for the further development of her field. However, the review of her application did not identify any relevance for the social, economic and/or political development of her native country / region. Can I apply even if I am not resident in a developing country or a transition country (e. g. also Germany)? The aim of the programme is to enable highly qualified academics from abroad to come to Germany to conduct a research stay here. Applicants should therefore be living and working outside Germany at the time of application (this also applies if contracted with institutions in Germany). Eligible applicants must have lived in a developing or transition country (list of countries, PDF) for a minimum of 12 months in the 18-month period prior to submission of the application. If you are applying for a Fellowship for Experienced Researchers (more than 4 years after the PhD) and you are not resident in an eligible country (including Germany, see the list of countries) at the time of application, you must additionally have a permanent job in one of the eligible countries. If in doubt, please contact us before you submit your application so we can advise you (info[at]avh. de). Can I apply if I completed my schooling and a university degree, or a university degree and a doctorate, in Germany? If you completed your schooling and a university degree, or a university degree and a doctorate, in Germany, you are a so-called educational resident and are eligible to apply provided that your uninterrupted, permanent place of residence and work has been in a developing or transition country for more than 5 years. If in doubt, send us a seamless CV and list of your publications so that we can then advise you (info[at]avh. de). Do I need to know German in order to apply? Natural scientists and engineers: good knowledge of German or English is sufficient. Scholars in the humanities and social sciences: should have knowledge of German if it is necessary to carry out their research successfully. In this case, a German language certificate confirming proficiency must be submitted. Otherwise, a good knowledge of English is sufficient. Physicians: If the research involves work with patients, the candidate must have a good knowledge of German (language certificate required). Otherwise, a good knowledge of English is sufficient. English or German is my native language. Do I have to submit a language certificate proving my proficiency? No, a language certificate is not required. I'm a physician (MD / Dr. med. ). Are there any special admission requirements? You are eligible to apply if you hold a research doctorate or a comparable academic degree. In addition, please read our Admission Questionnaire for Physicians (MD / Dr. med. ) for detailed information. If you have several research doctorates, the above mentioned FAQ on the subject of ""several doctorates"" applies. Academic host Who can be my academic host? Any researcher working at a university or research institution in Germany who offers to make research facilities available for the research stay may act as your host. If you have already worked in Germany for a longer period of time (12 months or more) you should look for a new academic environment for another guest stay in Germany. Applications that involve returning to the supervisor of the doctoral thesis or to the mentor of a longer postdoctoral stay are generally rejected by the Selection Committee on the basis of a lack of further independent academic development. How can I find an academic host? You are free to choose your own academic host. The Humboldt Foundation does not provide any direct support in finding a host. We would like to draw your attention to the following search engines for hosts and research institutes: Institutes at German universities and other research institutions Searchable Portal (GERiT) of the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) Research facilities, disciplines and research in Germany Research portal of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) Research Map Hochschulrektorenkonferenz (HRK) Research facilities, researchers and projects of the DFG in Germany and worldwide GEPRIS - Database of the German Research Foundation Research facilities, disciplines and researchers in Germany and worldwide World of Learning KISSWIN Communication and information platform on career paths and funding opportunities for junior academics We would also like to draw your attention to the open access part of the Network Online. This database features a large proportion of the Foundation's more than 30,000 academics sponsored worldwide. Here you can search for names, disciplines and keywords. Can I conduct my research with two academic hosts? Yes. If the hosts work at different research institutes, they must each provide a host's statement and confirmation that research facilities can be made available. Will my host institute receive any additional funds for the costs it incurs in connection with my research stay? In general the host institute will receive an allowance for research costs of €800 per month for research in the field of natural sciences and engineering, and €500 for research in the field of humanities or social sciences. Please see the respective FAQ of the Department Sponsorship and Network. Preparation/Planning When and how often do Selection Committee Meetings take place? There are three Selection Committee Meetings each year: in February, June and October. Can I apply to several Humboldt Foundation fellowship programmes at the same time, or can I apply for a Humboldt Fellowship and the Sofja Kovalevskaja Award at the same time if I fulfil the formal requirements? No, it is not possible to apply to several fellowship programmes or the Sofja Kovalevskaja Award programme concurrently. Should you be rejected by any of them, you may, however, apply to any other programme as long as you fulfil the formal requirements. Can I apply for a fellowship from another institution at the same time I submit my application to the Humboldt Foundation? On principle, it is possible to file parallel applications. You must, however, indicate this on the application form and inform us immediately of any other applications you submit and any other sponsorship decisions that occur while we are considering your application. Can I conduct part of my research work abroad? If it is necessary for the success of the project, fellows may conduct research at research institutions in other parts of Europe during the fellowship period (excepting their country of origin). Please do not apply for this stay until you have been awarded the fellowship. As a rule, the total length of your Europe Research Stay may not exceed 25 percent of the projected total duration of sponsorship. Furthermore, if the fellowship is divided up into several stays (experienced researchers), the duration of the Europe Research Stay may on principle not exceed half the duration of the respective fellowship period. Research stays in the fellow's country of origin or in a non-European country will, however, normally result in a temporary suspension of the fellowship. Can I apply for a research fellowship for a period of less than six months? The first research stay in the context of a postdoctoral fellowship must last at least six months. Experienced researchers must also apply for a stay of at least six months, which can, however, be divided up into two blocks of three months. I am a postdoctoral researcher. Can I divide up my research stay? It is not possible to break up the research stay. When do I have to start the fellowship period at the latest? You must start the fellowship period within twelve months of being selected. Otherwise you will have to submit a new application. Will you pay the fellowship retroactively if I am already at the host institute at the time of being selected? No, the fellowship cannot be paid retroactively. Is the intensive German language course part of my research fellowship? A two- to four-month language course takes place immediately prior to the start of the research fellowship. The language fellowship is not part of the research fellowship. (In other words, if you apply for a two-month language co"

The key date for calculating the period following your doctorate is the date on which your application is received by the Humboldt Foundation. Which date is valid if I have several doctorates? In the case of multiple doctorates, the effective date is that of the first doctoral degree (PhD/CSc. ). My doctorate was completed more than four years ago. Can I apply for a fellowship for postdoctoral researchers? We cannot consider your application for a fellowship for postdoctoral researchers if your doctorate was completed more than four years ago. In case you already have a clearly recognisable own research profile and, as a rule, working at the level of at least assistant professor or junior research group leader, or have a record of several years of independent scientific work, you can apply for a fellowship for experienced researchers. If you have passed the deadline, an exception may be made in well-founded cases (e. g. recognition of parental leave). Please send us your CV and a list of your publications before you apply so we can advise you (info[at]avh. de). I obtained my doctorate more than twelve years ago. Can I still apply for a fellowship for experienced researchers? We cannot consider your application if you obtained your doctorate more than twelve years ago. If your doctorate is older than this, an exception may be made in well-founded cases (e. g. recognition of parental leave). Please send us your CV and a list of your publications before you apply so we can advise you (info[at]avh. de). My doctorate was completed less than four years ago. Can I apply for a fellowship for experienced researchers? Yes. You should, however, already have your own clearly recognisable research profile and, as a rule, be working at the level of at least assistant professor or junior research group leader, or have a record of several years of independent scientific work. How will child-rearing periods be considered in the application process? Periods in which you interrupted your academic activities after completing your doctorate in order to rear children may be taken into account as career breaks after examination. The proportionate offsetting of such periods is also possible. Please always indicate child-rearing periods when filling in our application form. Mothers can claim two extra years for each child born after their PhD plus any further verifiable parenting periods. Fathers and other persons responsible for raising children are only credited with verifiable parenting periods. In general, postdoctoral researchers may apply up to four years, and experienced researchers up to twelve years after completing their doctorates. Recognized child-rearing periods may correspondingly extend these maximum timeframes during which the submission of applications is possible. The extension is limited to 6 years. Please contact info[at]avh. de if you have any questions. Which other career breaks are considered in the application process? Periods in which you interrupted your academic activities after completing your doctorate in order to perform military or alternative service, to care for close relatives, due to long-term illness, or, for example, to care for children or due to the closure of institutes during a lockdown imposed to control an epidemic may be taken into account as career breaks after examination. The proportionate offsetting of such career breaks is also possible. Please always indicate career breaks when filling in our application form. Job hunting, unemployment and non-academic employment do not count as career breaks. In general, postdoctoral researchers may apply up to four years, and experienced researchers up to twelve years after completing their doctorates. Recognized career breaks may correspondingly extend these maximum timeframes during which the submission of applications is possible. The extension is limited to 6 years. Please contact info[at]avh. de if you have any questions. Are child-rearing periods taken into account in the assessment of academic achievements? Yes, because the assessment of academic achievements is always made on an individual basis at the Humboldt Foundation. Therefore, when filling in the application form, please specify all periods in which you partially or completely interrupted your academic activities after finishing your doctorate in order to rear children. The voluntary disclosure of private circumstances may help increase equal opportunities during the selection process. The consideration of your personal circumstances allows for a fairer assessment of your academic achievements. Please contact info[at]avh. de if you have any questions.

I am from a developing/transition country. Should I apply for a Humboldt or Georg Forster Research Fellowship? If your primary life focus (nationality and permanent residence) is in a developing or transition country (see list of countries) and your research is of relevance for that country's (or region's) further development (see examples below), we recommend that you apply for a George Forster Research Fellowship. A persuasive presentation of your work's relevance for development in your region is one of the key criteria used when your application is evaluated. For projects that would be classified as basic research, we recommend applying for a Humboldt Research Fellowship. Examples of applications with relevance to development: Example 1: Food security among children in Nigeria Foodstuffs that are contaminated with mycotoxins, the toxic metabolic substances produced by fungi, present a challenge for the people of Nigeria. As part of a Georg Forster Research Fellowship, one Humboldtian examined with the help of biomonitoring the degree to which Nigerian children and adolescents are exposed to mycotoxins in foodstuffs. In this way she is striving to improve the food safety of the Nigerian people. Example 2: Climate change and stressed plants Plants emit a number of volatile organic compounds in response to heat and drought stress. During her guest visit in Germany, a Latin American Humboldtian studied the impact these emissions have on air quality and changes in the climate. Her findings were used to develop sustainable adaptation and mitigation strategies tailored to the region she comes from. These findings offer political stakeholders a scientifically proven basis for making decisions. Example 3: Improved tax enforcement through international co-operation Audits are a tried and tested tool in the fight against tax evasion. In the case of transnational audits, joint tax audits can be conducted by international teams. During her Georg Forster research stay in Germany, one Humboldtian examined the advantages of joint tax audits with the aim of formulating recommendations for action to develop and improve international tax law. By doing so, the Moldavian hopes to make a contribution to her country's integration into international tax law structures. Example 4: Water reservoirs Siltation of water reservoirs is a major problem for Iran's water supply. One Iranian Humboldtian dedicated his stay in Germany to working on methods to reduce sedimentation in water bodies which he can now transfer to his country of origin thanks to his existing contacts and good local connections. Example 5: Resource use A Burmese Humboldtian focused on the extraction of mineral resources in Myanmar. Thanks to his Georg Forster Fellowship he was able to expand his raw materials expertise as one of the only few excellent Burmese economic geologists. He is now making valuable contributions to the geoscience community in his country of origin and is advancing sustainable resource development and use there. The following examples were not accepted by the Georg Forster Fellowship Programme because they have little relevance to development: Example 1: Researching neurodegenerative diseases Worldwide neurodegenerative diseases pose an enormous problem for people suffering from them. Studying and designing possible treatment methods for such diseases requires costly equipment. One applicant planned to increase his knowledge of this type of technology and how to use it. It was not, however, apparent from his application how the skills he aimed to acquire in Germany could be put to practical use without having corresponding infrastructure in his native country. Example 2: Further development of cosmological models One applicant sought to further develop cosmological models (theoretical physics) with her research project. She convincingly demonstrated that the project would offer added value for the further development of her field. However, the review of her application did not identify any relevance for the social, economic and/or political development of her native country / region. Do I need to know German in order to apply? Natural scientists and engineers: good knowledge of German or English is sufficient. Scholars in the humanities and social sciences: should have knowledge of German if it is necessary to carry out their research successfully. In this case, a German language certificate confirming proficiency must be submitted. Otherwise, a good knowledge of English is sufficient. Physicians: if the research involves work with patients, the candidate must have a good knowledge of German (language certificate required). Otherwise, a good knowledge of English is sufficient. English or German is my native language. Do I have to submit a language certificate proving my proficiency? No, a language certificate is not required. I'm a physician (MD / Dr. med. ). Are there any special admission requirements? You are eligible to apply if you hold a research doctorate or a comparable academic degree. In addition, please read our Admission Questionnaire for Physicians (MD / Dr. med. ) for detailed information. If you have several research doctorates, the above mentioned FAQ on the subject of ""several doctorates"" applies. I already am or recently have been in Germany. Are there any formal grounds militating against my application? The aim of the programme is to enable highly qualified academics from abroad to come to Germany to conduct a research stay here. Applicants should therefore be living and/or working outside Germany at the time of application. If you have previously been to Germany, you may only apply if you have resided outside Germany for a minimum of 12 months in total in the 18-month period prior to submission of the application. Any time spent in Germany within those 18 months is taken into account, regardless of duration or reason. This also applies to employment contracts with institutions in Germany. If you have arrived in Germany recently you should submit your application as soon as possible, as we can only assess your eligibility and formally accept your application after it has been submitted. In all other cases you are unfortunately ineligible to apply. German citizens and/or educational residents* (see following FAQ) are generally ineligible to apply if they have been in Germany within the last 18 months prior to receipt of their application or are already in Germany at the time of applying. * Educational residents are individuals who have completed their school education and a university degree, or a university degree and their doctorate in Germany. Can I apply from abroad as a German citizen/educational resident? The aim of the programme is to enable highly qualified academics from abroad to come to Germany to conduct a research stay here. German citizens/educational residents* are thus not the target group of this funding programme. You are however eligible to apply if you are permanently working abroad and intend to return abroad immediately following the requested research stay. We consider you to be permanently established in a foreign country if you have unquestionably been living and working abroad for more than 10 years; for more than 5 years and meet one of the following criteria that unequivocally indicate strong ties to your current country of residence: a permanent/tenured position; additional citizenship of your country of residence; permanent permission to reside in your current country of residence (e. g. permanent residence permit, green card etc. ). Permission to reside based solely on your citizenship (e. g. for EU citizens as part of EU freedom of movement) is not accepted; other indications that you intend to permanently return to your current country of residence German citizens and/or educational residents* are generally ineligible to apply if they have been in Germany within the last 18 months prior to receipt of their application or are already in Germany at the time of applying. If you intend to apply in order to prepare your permanent return to Germany, we recommend that you instead apply to the ""Temporary Positions"" programme of the DFG. If in doubt, we would ask to send us only your complete CV and a list of your publications, so that we can advise you. Please state which criterion applies to you (info[at]avh. de). * Educational residents are individuals who have completed their school education and a university degree, or a university degree and their doctorate in Germany. Academic host Who can be my academic host? Any researcher working at a university or research institution in Germany who offers to make research facilities available for the research stay may act as your host. If you have already worked in Germany for a longer period of time (12 months or more) you should look for a new academic environment for another guest stay in Germany. Applications that involve returning to the supervisor of the doctoral thesis or to the mentor of a longer postdoctoral stay are generally rejected by the Selection Committee on the basis of a lack of further independent academic development. How can I find an academic host? You are free to choose your own academic host. The Humboldt Foundation does not provide any direct support in finding a host. We would like to draw your attention to the following search engines for hosts and research institutes: Institutes at German universities and other research institutions Searchable Portal (GERiT) of the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) Research facilities, disciplines and research in Germany Research portal of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) Research Map Hochschulrektorenkonferenz (HRK) Research facilities, researchers and projects of the DFG in Germany and worldwide GEPRIS - Database of the German Research Foundation Research facilities, disciplines and researchers in Germany and worldwide World of Learning KISSWIN Communication and information platform on career paths and funding opportunities for junior academics We would also like to draw your attention to the open access part of the Network Online. This database features a large proportion of the Foundation's more than 25,000 academics sponsored worldwide. Here you can search for names, disciplines and keywords. Can I conduct my research with two academic hosts? Yes. If the hosts work at different research institutes, they must each provide a host's statement and confirmation that research facilities can be made available. Will my host institute receive any additional funds for the costs it incurs in connection with my research stay? In general the host institute will receive an allowance for research costs of €800 per month for research in the field of natural sciences and engineering, and €500 for research in the field of humanities or social sciences. Please see the respective FAQ of the Department Sponsorship and Network. Preparation/Planning Are there deadlines for submitting applications? There is no closing date for submitting applications. Applications are processed as part of an ongoing procedure. As soon as we have received your complete application we shall forward it to independent peer reviewers. Their written evaluations will then be presented to the selection committee at the next selection meeting at which a decision will be made. Please note that you can submit your application only after your host and your expert reviewers have uploaded all necessary documents. The date used to determine whether the applicant meets certain formal requirements, such as career stage limitations and stays in Germany, is the date on which the Humboldt Foundation receives the respective application. Selection committee meetings take place three times a year, in March, July and November. Applications should be submitted at least four to seven months ahead of the prospective selection meeting. A graphic display of the complete application process can be found above on this page. Can I apply to several Humboldt Foundation fellowship programmes at the same time, or can I apply for a Humboldt Fellowship and the Sofja Kovalevskaja Award at the same time if I fulfil the formal requirements? No, it is not possible to apply to several fellowship programmes or the Sofja Kovalevskaja Award programme concurrently. Should you be rejected by any of them, you may, however, apply to any other programme as long as you fulfil the formal requirements. Can I apply for a fellowship from another institution at the same time I submit my application to the Humboldt Foundation? On principle, it is possible to file parallel applications. You must, however, indicate this on the application form a"

Nominators Who is entitled to nominate a candidate? An established academic who is employed by a university or other research institution in Germany must take the initiative to nominate a candidate for the Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel Research Award. Self-nomination is not possible. Nominees Is there an age limit for nominees? No, but please take note of the section ""For how many years after his or her doctorate can a candidate be nominated?"". Can academics from any academic discipline be nominated for a research award? Yes, there are no quotas for specific subjects; nominations can be made in any academic discipline. Is an academic eligible to be nominated for a research award if he or she has already received an award from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation? Academics who have already received a (research) fellowship from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation are eligible for nomination. A nomination, typically, is possible five years after completion of initial sponsorship (if applicable, including extension) in a fellowship programme at the earliest. Academics who have already received a (research) award from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation are not eligible for another nomination. All Alexander von Humboldt Foundation alumni are eligible for alumni sponsorship measures. If you are unsure whether alumni sponsorship or a nomination would be more appropriate, please contact us at info[at]avh. de. May I nominate a candidate who has already stayed or is currently staying in Germany? At the time of nomination, the nominated candidate must have been predominantly living and working abroad for at least five years. Previous and short-term stays in Germany (such as visiting professorship) do not usually exclude a candidate from nomination. In cases of doubt, please contact us at info[at]avh. de so we can advise you. Can a German national be nominated? You may nominate academics with German citizenship if they have been working abroad in an academic position for at least five years. Please send us a CV and a list of publications before you nominate the candidate so we can advise you (info[at]avh. de). Can I nominate an academic who does not hold a doctorate? Nomination is possible if a doctorate is either not customary or not possible in the nominee's country of origin or discipline, and if the nominee can prove that his or her academic performance is equivalent to a Ph. D. , e. g. by academic publications for internationally reviewed journals and publishing houses. Should this be the case, please send us a CV and a list of publications before you nominate the candidate so we can advise you (info[at]avh. de). Are roughly the same number of awards granted to men and women? Is priority given to either a male or female nominee if both candidates are considered to be equally qualified and suitable? No. Academic excellence is the sole criterion for selection. The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation does, however, explicitly welcome the nomination of qualified female academics because women are currently significantly under-represented in this programme. Award amount What is the sum of the award? The award amount is €45,000. How is the award amount paid? Does the nominee need a German bank account for this purpose? The award money is paid in instalments. The first instalment is normally transferred to the cashier's office of the host university at the beginning of the research stay in Germany and can be collected there by the award winner. For the payment of further instalments, award winners are asked to open an account at a bank of their choice as soon as possible after arriving in Germany, and to provide the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation with their account number, bank address and bank code. The research award is granted in recognition of the academic achievements and the personality of the award winner and may only be claimed by the award winner personally. Similarly, payment of the award amount may also only be made to the award winner personally and exclusively. Claims to the award may not be transferred. Is the award amount subject to taxation? Award winners are responsible for all matters pertaining to their taxation. However, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation would like to point out that according to German tax law, awards are not usually subject to income tax in Germany if they are primarily granted in recognition of the award winner's lifetime achievement or entire academic work, personality, convictions, or function as a role-model. This is precisely the intention of the Humboldt Foundation in granting the research awards which honour the entire life's work of award winners in their capacity as internationally outstanding researchers. Tax law in the award winners' home countries or countries of residence may contain special regulations on the taxation of awards. If in doubt, a tax accountant in the award winner's own country should be consulted. Nomination documents Will you confirm receipt of my nomination? As soon as we receive your nomination we will notify you by email. We will also notify you if any important documents or information are missing from your nomination. Is there a template for the list of publications? Yes. You will need to submit two lists: a) a list of key publications and b) a complete list of publications covering the past 10 years. a) Name three to five key publications from the nominee's entire body of work and explain the special significance of each one of these key publications (e. g. significant scientific breakthrough). b) Please draw up a complete, chronological list of all the nominee's scientific publications of the past 10 years (including all authors, identifying the corresponding author(s), titles, publisher/journal, edition, year, first and last page number); if relevant, also include published conference papers and patents. If applicable, you may include a link to the nominee's complete digital bibliography at the beginning of the list. What will happen to the nomination documents after the selection procedure has been completed? Will they be destroyed or archived, and will they be treated confidentially? Unless I expressly object, my nomination documents will be archived for a period of seven years and then destroyed in a manner compliant with data protection regulations. All documents are, of course, treated with utmost confidentiality. It is a matter of course that peer reviewers and committee members are also obliged to observe strict confidentiality. Preparation/Planning Are there deadlines for submitting nominations? No. Nominations may be submitted online at any time. However, when planning, please keep in mind that the selection committee meets only twice a year (in March and October). Preparing a selection committee meeting - processing the respective nomination and obtaining peer reviews - takes approximately six months. When does the Selection Committee meet? Decisions are made twice a year in spring and in autumn. Reviewing a nomination takes approximately six months. Will you sponsor participation in German language courses? The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation strongly encourages its award winners and their partners to learn German during their research stay so that they can participate in social and cultural life in Germany beyond their research work. Upon request, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation can pay the cost of a German language course. Selection procedure Who will review my nomination? Your nomination will be reviewed by independent peer reviewers who are appointed by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation for this purpose. Who will decide on my nomination? The final decision on all nominations is made by the Selection Committee that is appointed by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation for this purpose. Who is on the Selection Committee? The Selection Committee consists of academics and researchers of all disciplines and a smaller number of members who are not associated with any specific discipline (e. g. representatives of the funding institutions). The Selection Committee decides jointly on all submitted nominations. An award is granted if two thirds of the Committee members vote in favour of application nomination and sufficient financial resources are available. The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation has no vote on the Selection Committee. The experts in each discipline are expected to be internationally established, have a broad understanding of their discipline and experience of serving on committees. For each new or additional appointment, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation creates suggestion lists in consultation with the respective predecessors on the Committee and other experts in the same or related disciplines, and integrating recommendations from the German Research Foundation (DFG). The order in which the suggested academics are listed is determined by the President of the Humboldt Foundation. Appointments are confirmed by the Foundation's Board of Trustees. The term of office is initially three years; it can be extended twice by reappointment. The total number and distribution of experts across disciplines in the committees depends on the average number of received nominations and their distribution across disciplines. New appointments replacing departing experts or to add disciplines not previously represented are based on the following factors: Academic qualification, A balanced age structure, A balanced gender ratio, Balanced regional distribution of experts, including academics from abroad Please refer to this link for a list of Selection Committee members for the allocation of Alexander von Humboldt Foundation research awards. Will the nominee be notified about his or her nomination? No. During the nomination process, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation will only be in contact with the nominator, and only the nominator will be notified of the result of the Selection Committee meeting. Only if the nominee is selected, will he or she receive the conferral documents approximately four weeks after the selection meeting. Selection How high is the success rate? In recent years, approximately 35% of all nominations have been successful. What are the most important selection criteria? The main selection criteria are proven international recognition of the nominated individual, who is already noted for outstanding academic results and from whom further pioneering achievements with significant impact can be expected. Will the nominee be notified of the outcome of the selection procedure? The nominee will not be informed of a rejection. Communication during the selection process takes place between the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and the nominator in Germany only. In case an award is conferred, the winner will receive the award documents approximately four weeks after the selection meeting. Can I re-nominate a researcher whose nomination was not successful? Yes, if the nominee has shown significant academic development since their previous application was rejected. The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation's headquarters are happy to answer any questions nominees may have regarding the assessment of this question. Acceptance of the Award / Use and Provision of Award Funds How soon after the selection decision can the research stay begin? The research stay in Germany can normally begin as early as four to six weeks after the selection decision and should start within 12 months after conferral, if possible. The date must be agreed upon with the academic host in advance. Does the nominee have to complete his or her stay in one go, or can it be divided up? The duration of the research stay of up to one full year may be divided into segments. However, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation will only cover travel costs once. Please inform the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation about the time schedule for the research stay early so that all necessary preparations can be made in good time. May the award winner teach at the host university during his or her stay, or is it strictly a research stay? Should the award winner wish to teach during the research stay, he or she may do so. Will travel costs be covered? The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation pays a lump sum to cover the award winner's travel costs (return tickets). The conferral documents contain a list of lump sums for travel. The relevant sum will be transferred to the award winner's German bank account (which the award winner will have to open) after the research stay in Germany has begun. The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation can only cover the costs of one return journey, regardless of the number of trips to and from Germany. A lump sum towards the travel costs of marital partners and children under the age of 18 accompanying the award winner may be granted if they stay with the award winner in Germany for at least six months. Fifty per cent of the lump sum will be paid for children between the ages of two and eleven, ten per cent for children under the age of two. The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation will not cover any additional expenses for the transportation of luggage. Do I have to file a report after completion of the research stay? Towards the end of the research stay, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation will ask award winners for a brief, informal report on their experiences, which should also contain information on the academic collaboration with the host institution and contacts with other research institutions in Germany and abroad. They will also be asked to comment on their own and their families' personal impressions during their stay in Germany. We are particularly interested in comparisons with the situation in award winners' own countries and welcome any suggestions regarding the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation's sponsorship programmes. The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation also asks academic hosts in Germany to report on their experiences in their cooperation with award winners. These reports are very important and revealing for the foundation, because foreign guests often observe with a keener eye and are able to make more balanced judgements due to their greater critical distance. The reports are analysed carefully and confidentially. In addition, they can help the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation to continue improving its programmes and make them as effective as possible.

FAQ Nominators Who is entitled to nominate a candidate? An established academic who is employed by a university or other research institution in Germany must take the initiative to nominate a candidate for the Humboldt Research Award. Self-nomination is not possible. Nominees Is there an age limit for nominees? No. Are child-rearing periods taken into account in the assessment of academic achievements? Yes, because the assessment of academic achievements is always made on an individual basis at the Humboldt Foundation. Therefore, when filling in the application form, please specify all periods in which the nominee partially or completely interrupted academic activities after finishing a doctorate in order to rear children. The voluntary disclosure of private circumstances may help increase equal opportunities during the selection process. The consideration of personal circumstances allows for a fairer assessment of academic achievements. Please contact info[at]avh. de if you have any questions. Are other career breaks taken into account in the assessment of academic achievements? Yes, because the assessment of academic achievements is always made on an individual basis at the Humboldt Foundation. Therefore, when filling in the application form, please specify all periods in which the nominee partially or completely interrupted academic activities after finishing a doctorate in order to perform military or alternative service, to care for close relatives or due to long-term illness. Job hunting, unemployment and non-academic employment do not count as career breaks. The voluntary disclosure of private circumstances may help increase equal opportunities during the selection process. The consideration of personal circumstances allows for a fairer assessment of academic achievements. Please contact info[at]avh. de if you have any questions. Can academics from any academic discipline be nominated for a research award? Yes, there are no quotas for specific subjects; nominations can be made in any academic discipline. Is an academic eligible to be nominated for a research award if he or she has already received an award from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation? Academics who have already received a (research) fellowship from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation are eligible for nomination. A nomination, typically, is possible five years after completion of initial sponsorship (if applicable, including extension) in a fellowship programme at the earliest. Academics who have already received a (research) award from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation are not eligible for another nomination. All Alexander von Humboldt Foundation alumni are eligible for alumni sponsorship measures. If you are unsure whether alumni sponsorship or a nomination would be more appropriate, please contact us at info[at]avh. de. May I nominate a candidate who has already stayed or is currently staying in Germany? At the time of nomination, the nominated candidate must have been predominantly living and working abroad for at least five years. Previous and short-term stays in Germany (such as visiting professorship) do not usually exclude a candidate from nomination. In cases of doubt, please contact us at info[at]avh. de so we can advise you. Can a German national be nominated? You may nominate academics with German citizenship if they have been working abroad in an academic position for at least five years. Please send us a CV and a list of publications before you nominate the candidate so we can advise you (info[at]avh. de). Can I nominate an academic who does not hold a doctorate? Nomination is possible if a doctorate is either not customary or not possible in the nominee's country of origin or discipline, and if the nominee can prove that his or her academic performance is equivalent to a Ph. D. , e. g. by academic publications for internationally reviewed journals and publishing houses. Should this be the case, please send us a CV and a list of publications before you nominate the candidate so we can advise you (info[at]avh. de). Are roughly the same number of awards granted to men and women? Is priority given to either a male or female nominee if both candidates are considered to be equally qualified and suitable? No. Academic excellence is the sole criterion for selection. The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation does, however, explicitly welcome the nomination of qualified female academics because women are currently significantly under-represented in this programme. Award amount What is the sum of the award? The award amount is €60,000. How is the award amount paid? Does the nominee need a German bank account for this purpose? The award money is paid in instalments. The first instalment is normally transferred to the cashier's office of the host university at the beginning of the research stay in Germany and can be collected there by the award winner. For the payment of further instalments, award winners are asked to open an account at a bank of their choice as soon as possible after arriving in Germany, and to provide the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation with their account number, bank address and bank code. The research award is granted in recognition of the academic achievements and the personality of the award winner and may only be claimed by the award winner personally. Similarly, payment of the award amount may also only be made to the award winner personally and exclusively. Claims to the award may not be transferred. Is the award amount subject to taxation? Award winners are responsible for all matters pertaining to their taxation. However, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation would like to point out that according to German tax law, awards are not usually subject to income tax in Germany if they are primarily granted in recognition of the award winner's lifetime achievement or entire academic work, personality, convictions, or function as a role-model. This is precisely the intention of the Humboldt Foundation in granting the research awards which honour the entire life's work of award winners in their capacity as internationally outstanding researchers. Tax law in the award winners' home countries or countries of residence may contain special regulations on the taxation of awards. If in doubt, a tax accountant in the award winner's own country should be consulted. Nomination documents Will you confirm receipt of my nomination? As soon as we receive your nomination we will notify you by email. We will also notify you if any important documents or information are missing from your nomination. Is there a template for the list of publications? Yes. You will need to submit two lists: a) a list of key publications and b) a complete list of publications covering the past 10 years. a) Name three to five key publications from the nominee's entire body of work and explain the special significance of each one of these key publications (e. g. significant scientific breakthrough). b) Please draw up a complete, chronological list of all the nominee's scientific publications of the past 10 years (including all authors, identifying the corresponding author(s), titles, publisher/journal, edition, year, first and last page number); if relevant, also include published conference papers and patents. If applicable, you may include a link to the nominee's complete digital bibliography at the beginning of the list. What will happen to the nomination documents after the selection procedure has been completed? Will they be destroyed or archived, and will they be treated confidentially? Unless I expressly object, my nomination documents will be archived for a period of seven years and then destroyed in a manner compliant with data protection regulations. All documents are, of course, treated with utmost confidentiality. It is a matter of course that peer reviewers and committee members are also obliged to observe strict confidentiality.

Questions and Answers Nomination requirements For how many years after his or her doctorate can a candidate be nominated? We cannot consider a nomination if the candidate completed his or her doctorate more than 18 years ago. An exception may be made in well-founded cases (e. g. recognition of parental leave). In this case, please contact the Humboldt Foundation so we can advise you (info[at]avh. de). What determines the date of a doctorate? The relevant date is that of completing the final academic part of the doctoral process (e. g. , defence of thesis, doctoral viva). This date will usually be included on your doctoral certificate alongside the date of issue. The key date for calculating the period following your doctorate is the date on which your application is received by the Humboldt Foundation. Which date is valid if the nominee has several doctorates? If the nominee holds several doctorates, the doctorate that is closest to the requested research outline in terms of its subject matter is relevant. Please list both doctorate dates with the associated disciplines in the nominee's CV on the application form. How will child-rearing periods be considered in the nomination process? Periods in which the nominee interrupted academic activities after completing a doctorate in order to rear children may be taken into account as career breaks after examination. The proportionate offsetting of such periods is also possible. Please always indicate child-rearing periods of the nominee when filling in our nomination form. Mothers can claim two extra years for each child born after their PhD plus any further verifiable parenting periods. Fathers and other persons responsible for raising children are only credited with verifiable parenting periods. In general, nominations are permitted up to 18 years after completing the doctorate. Recognized child-rearing periods may correspondingly extend this period during which the submission of a nomination is possible. The extension is limited to 6 years. Please contact info[at]avh. de if you have any questions. Which other career breaks are considered in the nomination process? Periods in which the nominee interrupted academic activities after completing a doctorate in order to perform military or alternative service, to care for close relatives, due to long-term illness or, for example, to care for children or due to the closure of institutes during a lockdown imposed to control an epidemic may be taken into account as career breaks after examination.

Award winners are responsible for all matters pertaining to their taxation. However, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation would like to point out that according to German tax law, awards are not usually subject to income tax in Germany if they are primarily granted in recognition of the award winner's lifetime achievement or entire academic work, personality, convictions, or function as a role-model. This is precisely the intention of the Humboldt Foundation in granting the research awards which honour the entire life's work of award winners in their capacity as internationally outstanding researchers. Tax law in the award winners' home countries or countries of residence may contain special regulations on the taxation of awards. If in doubt, a tax accountant in the award winner's own country should be consulted. Nomination documents Will you confirm receipt of my nomination? As soon as we receive your nomination we will notify you by email. We will also notify you if any important documents or information are missing from your nomination. Is there a required format for the list of publications? Yes. You must provide a complete, chronologically ordered list of the nominee's academic publications over the past ten years (stating all authors, titles, publisher/journal, edition, first and last page number), including any relevant published conference presentations and patents. For patents, please indicate the current legal status; submitted, disclosed, patent granted, as well as the complete title, submission date and patent number. What will happen to the nomination documents after the selection procedure has been completed? Will they be destroyed or archived, and will they be treated confidentially? Unless I expressly object, my nomination documents will be archived for a period of seven years and then destroyed in a manner compliant with data protection regulations. All documents are, of course, treated with utmost confidentiality. It is a matter of course that peer reviewers and committee members are also obliged to observe strict confidentiality. Preparation/Planning Are there deadlines for submitting nominations? No. Nominations may be submitted online at any time. However, when planning, please keep in mind that the selection committee meets only twice a year (in March and October). Preparing a selection committee meeting - processing the respective nomination and obtaining peer reviews - takes approximately six months. When does the Selection Committee meet? Decisions are made twice a year in spring and in autumn. Reviewing a nomination takes approximately six months. Will you sponsor participation in German language courses? The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation strongly encourages its award winners and their partners to learn German during their research stay so that they can participate in social and cultural life in Germany beyond their research work. Upon request, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation can pay the cost of a German language course. Selection procedure Who will review my nomination? Your nomination will be reviewed by independent peer reviewers who are appointed by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation for this purpose. Who will decide on my nomination? The final decision on all nominations is made by the Selection Committee that is appointed by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation for this purpose. Who is on the Selection Committee? The Selection Committee consists of academics and researchers of all disciplines and a smaller number of members who are not associated with any specific discipline (e. g. representatives of the funding institutions). The Selection Committee decides jointly on all submitted nominations. An award is granted if two thirds of the Committee members vote in favour of application nomination and sufficient financial resources are available. The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation has no vote on the Selection Committee. The experts in each discipline are expected to be internationally established, have a broad understanding of their discipline and experience of serving on committees. For each new or additional appointment, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation creates suggestion lists in consultation with the respective predecessors on the Committee and other experts in the same or related disciplines, and integrating recommendations from the German Research Foundation (DFG). The order in which the suggested academics are listed is determined by the President of the Humboldt Foundation. Appointments are confirmed by the Foundation's Board of Trustees. The term of office is initially three years; it can be extended twice by reappointment. The total number and distribution of experts across disciplines in the committees depends on the average number of received nominations and their distribution across disciplines. New appointments replacing departing experts or to add disciplines not previously represented are based on the following factors: Academic qualification, A balanced age structure, A balanced gender ratio, Balanced regional distribution of experts, including academics from abroad Please refer to this link for a list of Selection Committee members for the allocation of Alexander von Humboldt Foundation research awards. Will the nominee be notified about his or her nomination? No. During the nomination process, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation will only be in contact with the nominator, and only the nominator will be notified of the result of the Selection Committee meeting. Only if the nominee is selected, will he or she receive the conferral documents approximately four weeks after the selection meeting. Selection What are the most important selection criteria? The main selection criteria are proven international recognition of the nominated individual as an especially qualified applied researcher who is already noted for outstanding results and from whom pioneering achievements with significant impact can be expected in the future. Will the nominee be notified of the outcome of the selection procedure? The nominee will not be informed of a rejection. Communication during the selection process takes place between the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and the nominator in Germany only. In case an award is conferred, the winner will receive the award documents approximately four weeks after the selection meeting. Can I re-nominate a researcher whose nomination was not successful? Yes, if the nominee has shown significant academic development since their previous application was rejected. The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation's headquarters are happy to answer any questions nominees may have regarding the assessment of this question. Acceptance of the Award / Use and Provision of Award Funds How soon after the selection decision can the research stay begin? The research stay in Germany can normally begin as early as four to six weeks after the selection decision and should start within 12 months after conferral, if possible. The date must be agreed upon with the academic host in advance. Does the nominee have to complete his or her stay in one go, or can it be divided up? The duration of the research stay of up to one full year may be divided into segments. However, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation will only cover travel costs once. Please inform the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation about the time schedule for the research stay early so that all necessary preparations can be made in good time. May the award winner teach at the host university during his or her stay, or is it strictly a research stay? Should the award winner wish to teach during the research stay, he or she may do so. Will travel costs be covered? The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation pays a lump sum to cover the award winner's travel costs (return tickets). The conferral documents contain a list of lump sums for travel. The relevant sum will be transferred to the award winner's German bank account (which the award winner will have to open) after the research stay in Germany has begun. The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation can only cover the costs of one return journey, regardless of the number of trips to and from Germany. A lump sum towards the travel costs of marital partners and children under the age of 18 accompanying the award winner may be granted if they stay with the award winner in Germany for at least six months. Fifty per cent of the lump sum will be paid for children between the ages of two and eleven, ten per cent for children under the age of two. The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation will not cover any additional expenses for the transportation of luggage. Do I have to file a report after completion of the research stay? Towards the end of the research stay, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation will ask award winners for a brief, informal report on their experiences, which should also contain information on the academic collaboration with the host institution and contacts with other research institutions in Germany and abroad. They will also be asked to comment on their own and their families' personal impressions during their stay in Germany. We are particularly interested in comparisons with the situation in award winners' own countries and welcome any suggestions regarding the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation's sponsorship programmes. The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation also asks academic hosts in Germany to report on their experiences in their cooperation with award winners. These reports are very important and revealing for the foundation, because foreign guests often observe with a keener eye and are able to make more balanced judgements due to their greater critical distance. The reports are analysed carefully and confidentially. In addition, they can help the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation to continue improving its programmes and make them as effective as possible. "
"Research Award for outstanding researchers from abroad The joint research award from the Max Planck Society and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation recognises excellent researchers from abroad for their outstanding academic achievements. The Max Planck-Humboldt Research Award is funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research and presented alternatingly in the natural and engineering sciences, the life sciences, and the humanities and social sciences. Designed to incentivise especially innovative international researchers to conduct research stays at academic institutions in Germany, the Max Planck-Humboldt Research Award allows award winners significant flexibility in organising their research stay in Germany. For more information please see the programme information for the Max Planck-Humboldt Research Award. Programme information (PDF, 52 KB) Press dossier Our sponsorship Award winners are given access to funding of 1. 5 million euros over a period of five years.

"Start your online nomination or continue your nomination in ""My Humboldt"" Start online nomination Continue nomination Germany's most valuable research award The Humboldt Professorship is financed by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. It enables the holder to conduct forward-thinking, long-term research at universities and research institutions in this country and makes a sustainable contribution to Germany's ability to compete internationally as a location for research. Since 2008, up to ten Humboldt Professorships have been granted every year as part of the International Research Fund for Germany. In 2020, additional Alexander von Humboldt Professorships for Artificial Intelligence (AI) were created. Dossier Humboldt Professorship - Award Winners and background information WANTED: Alexander von Humboldt Professors (female) The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation is keen to award more Alexander von Humboldt Professorships to women academics. In the last 12 years, the share of top female researchers nominated for Germany's most valuable research award to date was approximately 15 percent. The behavioural ecologist Margaret Crofoot has been an Alexander von Humboldt Professor at the University of Konstanz since 2019. For the American, being in a minority of women in world-class research is a novel experience. A multimedia reportage on Crofoot's research into the group behaviour of humans and apes as well as her experience of Germany as a location for research: Multimedia report The Alexander von Humboldt Professor Margaret Crofoot describes her research methods and talks about her role as a model for women in science. Focus: Artificial Intelligence AI and Us - what artificial intelligence means for our lives As a contribution to the German Government's Artificial Intelligence Strategy, up to 2024, 30 additional Alexander von Humboldt Professorships are being established in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Researchers from all research areas who address the investigation and use of AI as well as its impact on society are eligible to be nominated. Humboldt Professorship - Programme Information (PDF, 42 KB) Humboldt Professorship for Artificial Intelligence - Programme Information KI (PDF, 145 KB) Information on the cross-disciplinary programme scope of AI (PDF, 115 KB) Our sponsorship The award amount totals €5 million for academics in experimental disciplines and €3. 5 million for researchers in theoretical disciplines and is made available for a period of five years. The sponsorship facilitates internationally competitive general conditions that build the foundations for award winners' long-term academic future in Germany. This applies both to salaries and the financial resources for their research work. The Humboldt Foundation offers award winners as much individual support as possible. Regulations on the use of funds (PDF, 680 KB) Information and Recommendations for Humboldt Professors (PDF, 1 MB) Support for research award winners during the research stay Alumni programmes Who is eligible to make a nomination? Universities in Germany are eligible to make a nomination. Non-university research institutions in Germany may also initiate a nomination in conjunction with an eligible German university. Nominations must be submitted to the Humboldt Foundation via the rector or president of the respective university and, if applicable, the academic directorate or board of the non-university research institution. Who is eligible to be nominated? Nominations may be made for exceptionally qualified world leaders in their fields who are established as academics abroad and would be eligible to be appointed to a professorship in Germany. What are the important points in a nomination? Apart from the nominee's academic excellence, the crucial criterion for granting the award is the persuasiveness of the strategy drawn up by the nominating institution for integrating the award winner in the institution and its importance for achieving its strategic goals. Nominations have a good chance of success if they enjoy the full support of the university leadership, view the Humboldt Professorship as an integral part of the university's overall development strategy and relate to a department that is earmarked for or has already embarked on significant development of its particular focus and structure. The nominating institutions must therefore address the following points in detail: the nominee's academic excellence her/his potential to fit with the institution's planned development the nominating research institution's strategic development planning with regard, for example, to reinforcing its capacity to compete internationally a guarantee that the nominee can be sustainably integrated in the structure of the research institution even after Alexander von Humboldt Foundation sponsorship has come to an end How to make a nomination Nominations can be submitted online at any time. Please use the relevant online nomination form and address all the points listed in the notes in detail and, if possible, in the order suggested. Also upload the documents required. We will confirm receipt of the nomination by e-mail as soon as the documents reach us. It goes without saying that all information will be treated in strict confidence. If you have any questions or doubts, please contact us (avh-professur[at]avh. de). We will be pleased to help. Information for nominators Information for independent peer reviewers Selection procedure The closing dates for nominations are 15 April and 15 September. The review process by independent peer reviewers from Germany and abroad takes approximately six months. An independent selection committee composed of researchers from various disciplines meets twice a year to decide on the nominations under consideration. It makes its decision on the basis of the nominee's academic excellence and the strategy submitted by the nominating institution. The competition between nominations is independent of discipline. There are no quotas for countries, research areas or the gender of the individuals nominated. We will inform nominators of the selection decision immediately after the meeting. If the nomination is unsuccessful, we will provide information on the level of competition and the selection criteria on request. Members of the Committee for the Allocation of the Alexander von Humboldt Professorship - International Award for Research in Germany Rules of good scientific practice Nominees and nominators must always abide by the rules of good scientific practice (PDF) and the principles of scientific ethics. FAQ Counselling Where do I find answers to the questions that are not addressed in these FAQs? If you have any questions or comments regarding the programme, feel free to contact Alexander von Humboldt Foundation headquarters. We strongly recommend applicants to contact the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation prior to submission to clarify any questions pending: Email: avh-professur[at]avh. de Regina Basse, Tel. +49-(0)228-833-170 Walter Denk, Tel. +49-(0)228-833-147 Dr. Michelle Herte (Artificial Intelligence), Tel. +49-(0)228-833-550. Processing may be delayed if applications are submitted incomplete or require further clarification. For detailed information on previously awarded Humboldt Professorships see http://www. humboldt-professur. de/en. What are the basic differences between an Alexander von Humboldt Professorship and many other endowed professorships? You can apply for a Humboldt Professorship in any academic discipline. The Humboldt Foundation makes no stipulations on this point. The Humboldt Professorship is intended for the long term, i. e. the receiving institution must ensure from the beginning that the award winner will be given a tenured academic leadership position when the five-year sponsorship period comes to an end. This will usually be a W3 position. With the administrative lump sum (see ""award funds"") the Humboldt Foundation provides the receiving institution with a tool that will facilitate the transition from Humboldt Foundation financing to its own financing. Preparing an application What are the most important application criteria? The nominee's academic qualifications, indicating that he or she is clearly at the forefront of the respective discipline internationally. The persuasiveness of the concept outlining the nominee's importance for and prospective involvement in the process of achieving the nominating institution's strategic goals. There are no quotas for countries or disciplines, for example. Which concepts promise chances of success? It is assumed that the Alexander von Humboldt Professorship will contribute to the internationalisation of especially promising research areas in Germany. It is expected that synergies will be achieved in the focus and structure of the academic environment at the receiving institution. Even though the award winners will be at the centre of the sponsorship provided by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, they will also be the starting point for sustainable structural change both at the receiving universities and research institutions as well as in their environment. As such, they should act as a catalyst for the continuation of development at the receiving institution. The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation expects the receiving institution to make a substantial contribution, going beyond providing basic equipment and facilities, already from the start of sponsorship. This contribution is to be complemented meaningfully by the measures financed from the award funds. Under what circumstances is it worthwhile to submit an application? Only applications which have the full support of the university leadership have a chance of being successful. The Humboldt Professorship is conceived as an integral part of the university's overall strategic development. You should therefore choose a department which is a planning major realignment and restructuring or has already embarked on this process. Are there guidelines for joint applications by universities and non-university research institutions? The application must indicate how the Humboldt Professor's work, as well as the award funds (working group, material investments), are to be distributed. Precise figures are not required. The Humboldt Professorship must be utilised to strengthen the university significantly. It is not possible that the Humboldt Professorship should almost exclusively benefit the non-university research institution, i. e. that the university should only submit a pro forma application. What agreements should the applicant institution in Germany make with the candidate before submitting an application? There are enormous personal and organisational consequences resulting from being appointed to a Humboldt Professorship. At the time the application is submitted the nominee must confirm that he or she will move to your institution in Germany on a permanent basis if the professorship is awarded. Guarantees must be given that the candidate will be able to embark on the research work in Germany twelve months after the selection committee's decision at the latest. Thus, prior to application, the nominating institution should draw up as detailed a scenario as possible and come to an agreement with the nominee as to how he or she should be involved in the receiving institution. We also recommend you to discuss the details of the appointment offer in advance, both in relation to the items to be financed from the award funds as well as those to be covered by the contribution to be made by the university. In addition, you should discuss how the position is to be continued after sponsorship has come to an end - this also helps to underpin the presentation in the application package. Experience shows that this also has a beneficial effect on later appointment negotiations. Points to be discussed might include salary structures for the award winner and the working group teaching duties dual career options staffing resources, possibly a working group budget opportunities and limits for staff recruitment (employment contracts for members of the working group, advertising formalities; contracts for knowledge bearers also moving to Germany may hold surprises) pension provision, including previously accrued pension rights depending on age: potential concept for a senior professorship technical resources, facilities financial and technical challenges involved in laboratory relocation; time required for acquiring laboratory equipment current structures in the receiving department ""road map"" for commencing work in Germany and completing research abroad legal aspects pertaining to research in Germany, e. g. in relation to legislation on stem cells, animal rights, safety at work and buildings etc. ; scheduling applications for permission, if applicable current relationship of the candidate to universities and research institutions in Germany (mentoring of doctoral or habilitation theses, working group leaderships etc. ). It may be important to contact the Humboldt Foundation in advance to discuss whether any formal obstacles speak against a nomination (cf. FAQs on target group for Humboldt Professorships) What stage should have been reached in appointment or employment procedures before an application is submitted? When the application is received an appointment may have been offered but it may not have been accepted. Applications are independent of appointment or employment procedures; it may be necessary to submit additional information (see hints in the online form). Should a researcher be nominated prior to the appointment or advertising process, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation recommends the nominating university and non-university research institution to reach an agreement on the potential appointment or employment with the relevant committees, so that in the event of a positive award decision, an appointment or employment decision can be made without further internal coordination. Should the appointment be accepted prior to the decision on awarding the Humboldt Professorship, we recommend justifying the importance of the Humboldt Professorship funds for recruiting this top researcher. Can a university submit several applications at the same time, and can several Humboldt Professors work at the same university concurrently? Yes. Applicant university / research institution Which institutions are eligible to apply Any university in Germany is eligible to apply. Non-university research institutions in Germany may make a nomination jointly with a university. Joint applications make sense when both partners would benefit significantly from such a professorship. This must be explained convincingly in the joint university concept. Sponsorship must benefit the university to a large degree. Can two universities submit a joint nomination? Yes, it is possible for two universities to submit a nomination jointly. In the application, the universities must explain how they are going to cooperate in the recruitment of the nominee and at which university, and in which way, the nominee will be integrated. Target group for a Humboldt Professorship May researchers nominate themselves? No, self-nomination is not possible. What constitutes an eligible candidate? The programme addresses ""research luminaries"" of all disciplines from abroad. Choose your candidate carefully with an eye to academic excellence and the greatest possible coherence between his or her research profile and your strategic development planning. What qualifications are the candidates expected to bring with them? Candidates are expected to hold a position of international eminence in their field and must also have the potential to lead their new department in Germany to the forefront of international excellence. Their academic qualifications should be comparable to that of a Leibniz Prize winner. Are Alexander von Humboldt Professorships awarded in certain preferred disciplines? No. Is there a formal age limit? No. As a matter of principle, however, the candidate must be eligible to be appointed to a professorship in Germany. Furthermore, the issue of sustainability should be observed: the proposal will normally be considered to be sustainable if the Humboldt Professor can be expected to continue productive academic activities for at least 10 years from the beginning of the sponsorship period. If retirement is scheduled to fall within this period, please explain how you intend to proceed in order to ensure the sustainability of the funding (concept for a senior professorship or similar). Are child-rearing periods taken into account in the assessment of academic achievements? Yes, because the assessment of academic achievements is always made on an individual basis at the Humboldt Foundation. Therefore, when filling in the application form, please specify all periods in which the nominee partially or completely interrupted academic activities after finishing a doctorate in order to rear children. The voluntary disclosure of private circumstances may help increase equal opportunities during the selection process. The consideration of personal circumstances allows for a fairer assessment of academic achievements. Please contact info[at]avh. de if you have any questions. Are other career breaks taken into account in the assessment of academic achievements? Yes, because the assessment of academic achievements is always made on an individual basis at the Humboldt Foundation. Therefore, when filling in the application form, please specify all periods in which the nominee partially or completely interrupted academic activities after finishing a doctorate in order to perform military or alternative service, to care for close relatives or due to long-term illness. Job hunting, unemployment and non-academic employment do not count as career breaks. The voluntary disclosure of private circumstances may help increase equal opportunities during the selection process. The consideration of personal circumstances allows for a fairer assessment of academic achievements. Please contact info[at]avh. de if you have any questions. Can a German national be nominated? Academics of German nationality are eligible to be nominated provided that they have established their academic careers abroad. This is considered to be the case if they fulfil at least one of the following conditions: They have a tenured position abroad. They have worked abroad in an academic capacity for an uninterrupted period of at least five years. Is it possible to nominate an academic who has already accepted an appointment in Germany? No, with one exception: If the candidate accepts an appointment at the nominating institution after the Humboldt Foundation has received the application documents, it has no adverse effect on the application and does not formally exclude him or her from the selection procedure. Can the Humboldt Professor commute between his former location and Germany (""split appointment"")? Not indefinitely. However, there might be a transitional period during which he or she finalises current research or mentoring work with students and doctoral candidates abroad. May candidates be nominated who already are or have been in Germany immediately prior to nomination? Whether this academic is eligible to be nominated for a Humboldt Professorship depends on the type and duration of activity in Germany. Academics may usually be nominated if the stay in Germany was temporary, i. e. in the context of a visiting professorship. Academics who are academically established abroad, but also hold a regular position in Germany at the same time (such as a professorship, directorship or any other position under an employment or service contract), may not be nominated. If in doubt, please consult the Humboldt Foundation in advance. Is it possible to nominate an academic who is not permanently associated with any research institution? Yes, this is not an obstacle provided that he or she conducts research abroad on a long-term basis. If in doubt, please consult the Humboldt Foundation in advance. Is it possible to nominate an academic who has been sponsored by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in the past? Yes. Is it possible to submit a nomination for an academic who has previously been unsuccessful? Yes, this is possible. You should, however, definitely consult the Selection Department at the Humboldt Foundation (avh-professur[at]avh. de) before submitting a further application. Award funds Which factors must be taken into account in determining the Humboldt Professor's personal income? We recommend that you discuss the salary with the candidate as early as possible. In the interest of sustainability, you should ensure that the award winner will not suffer any loss of income even after the sponsorship period comes to an end. In general, any questions with regard to taxation and social security should be clarified. Personal income is normally subject to German income tax. The Humboldt Professor's personal income may be supplemented using funds allocated in connection with the Humboldt Professorship, or from other funding at the receiving institution's disposal. Hybrid financing and top-up benefits are also possible. Is it possible to use the award funds for research purposes only (i. e. not for salary payments)? Yes, this is possible, although15 percent of the award funds must be designated as a lump sum for administration. Must the application explain how the award funds are to be used? Yes, but only in general terms. A numerical breakdown of the intended use by type of expenditure will only be required after the Selection Committee has made a positive decision. Should we provide specific information on the use of the lump sum for administration? No, specific information is not required. We do recommend, however, that you provide some information on how you intend to utilise the lump sum for administration in order to integrate the Humboldt Professor into the receiving institution. How should the lump sum for administration be used? The so-called lump sum for administration, which amounts to 15 percent of the requested funding amount, represents the portion of the award funds that the receiving institution can use at its own discretion. The use of these funds is very flexible. They can be used to finance any measures to recruit the Humboldt Professor for the new institution and ensure that he or she remains long-term, such as integration or dual career measures or compensation for any pension entitlements that he or she may have accumulated abroad and forfeited upon relocation. Please contact the respective state ministries or pension offices for further information. It is not possible any more to build reserves from the lump sum for administration. The general purpose of the lump sum for administration is to help the receiving institution make the future Humboldt Professor an offer that is too good to refuse. It is therefore advisable to find out about the candidate's very specific wishes and needs in advance and to prepare a tailor-made package of measures. Selection procedure Will the Humboldt Foundation confirm receipt of the application? As soon as we receive your nomination we will notify you by email. We will also notify the contact person if any important documents or information are missing or need amending, usually a few weeks after receiving the application. Who reviews the nomination? Independent German and international peer reviewers will evaluate the application. Is it possible to name individual academics who should be excluded from the independent review process? This is possible but should only be invoked in exceptional cases, such as reviewers who are themselves applicants in the same appointment procedures. It is not possible to exclude entire ""schools"" from the review process. However, we do take the greatest care in selecting the individual, appropriate reviewers. Who decides on the applications? A Selection Committee appointed specifically for this purpose will make the final decision on the Humboldt Professorships by two-thirds majority. It is composed of academics of all disciplines and ex officio members. Humboldt Foundation headquarters has no voice on the Selection Committee. For the list of Selection Committee members visit: website. Who will be notified of the selection decision and when? The rectors or presidents as well as the directorates or boards of non-university research institutions will usually be notified on the first working day after the Selection Committee meeting. Rejected candidates will not receive a selection notice from the Humboldt Foundation; the Humboldt Professors are usually notified three working days after the Selection Committee meeting. Which deadlines must be observed after the selection decision? The date of the award letter to the Humboldt Professor serves as reference date for the following deadlines: within 4 weeks at the latest: submission of the declaration of acceptance; within 8 months at the latest: successful conclusion of appointment negotiations between award winner and receiving research institution; submission of the ""Agreements between the award winner and the receiving institution"" (cf. Form, Enclosure 1) to the 'Regulations on the use of funds') and the research and financial plan; within 12 months at the latest: award winner begins his or her work at the receiving research institution in Germany. In case these deadlines are not met, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation reserves the right to revoke the award. Selection How high is the success rate? Only those applications that leave no doubt whatsoever about the academic excellence of the candidate and the persuasiveness of the university concept will ultimately be approved. In the past, this applied to about one in four applications on average. To what extent should applicants and candidates be prepared for a negative decision? Applicants and candidates should plan for the possibility of a rejection. We recommend that you explore in advance under which conditions the candidate would be willing to transfer to the academic institution in Germany even without the support of the Humboldt Foundation. Does the Humboldt Foundation give reasons for a rejection? There is no detailed written explanation for a rejection. After each Selection Committee meeting, we are available by telephone to give you information on the competitive situation and the selection criteria for the Humboldt Professorships. We also give advice on potential future nominations. Appropriation, use and provision of funds Can award funds be transferred from one budgetary year to the next? Yes, within the sponsorship period of 5 years. Payments are made in instalments according to the financial plan and are effected - depending on the demand and the availability of budgetary means - as soon as possible. The cash balance as per Dec. 31st of each year must not exceed 20% of the total instalment paid that year; in exceptional cases this amount can be exceeded. How precise should the details on the ""fund request"" form be? As detailed as possible to help the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation's budgetary planning. By when should the entire amount of award funds be spent? By the end of the sponsorship period. Any remaining funds must be remitted to the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. How should travel expenses be claimed? According to the regulations governing the receiving institution (e. g. the respective state law on travel expenses). Is it possible to use award funds to finance the costs of an official mobile phone? An official mobile phone may be financed from award funds (""expendable items/miscellaneous""). Is it possible to take a lump-sum from the award funds to cover certain very small expenses (mobile phone, meals on journeys, public transport)? It is possible on principle; it is not forbidden in the regulations. How this ""ready cash"" is actually dealt with is a matter for agreement with the administration of the receiving institution. Does the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation subsidise moving expenses or may award funds be used to finance domestic moving expenses? The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation does not pay subsidies towards moving expenses. The regulations governing travel expenses for public service at the place of employment obtain (including the payment of moving expenses). Which sections of the receiving institution are entitled to the administrative flat-rate? Is it paid directly to the department in which the administrative costs are actually incurred or could the central administration/rectorate also make claims? This question has to be clarified with the receiving institution. In the agreement between the award winner and the receiving institution, as well as in the Regulations on the Use of Funds, the receiving institution in general is cited as the recipient of this lump-sum. Is the amount of the administrative flat-rate based on the original amount of award funds or may accrued interest also be taken into account in calculating the amount? The basis for calculating the administrative flat-rate is the original amount of award funds (excluding interest accrued). Is it possible to use award funds to finance invitations to national and foreign academics to hold guest lectures etc. at the award winner's receiving institution? (Travel expenses, accommodation, meals, remuneration)? Yes, based on the regulations and cost unit rates pertaining at the receiving institution. I would like to take my group on a cultural/scientific outing to Hamburg. May I use award funds for the travel expenses? Yes, award funds may be used to cover travel expenses as the outing arises from the employment situation which, apart from a salary, also includes other social contributions (which may embrace a group outing). May expenses incurred in connection with interviewing applicants for potential membership of the working group be financed from the award funds? To cover expenses incurred in connection with interviewing applicants the relevant regulations obtaining at the receiving institution should be the determining factor. May award funds be used to finance the cost of German language courses attended by members of the working group? If attending a language course is the precondition for working on the project successfully and providing it cannot be financed from other funding - yes. May the costs of entertaining (academic) guests be taken from the administrative flat-rate? The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation has no objections to using award funds to cover the costs of entertaining invited guests. And it is possible to use the administrative flat-rate for this purpose. In chapter III of the Regulations on the Use of Funds general information can be found on the sort of expenses covered by the administrative flat-rate. We should like to set up a small kitchen with a coffee machine, fridge, etc. for the staff and invited guests. May we finance these purchases from the award funds? Yes, preferably from the proportion of award funds earmarked for the administration of the host institution as the administrative flat-rate. Upon purchase, any equipment and utensils immediately become property of the receiving institution. May research funding from other sources (e. g. third-party funding from the DFG, EU etc. ) be applied for in addition to the award funds? Yes. Please note that you are obligated to inform the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation of applications for or any further funding granted for the same research project. Your contacts within the administration will advise you. It is forbidden to duplicate financing for one and the same research project (double funding). If additional funds are granted for a subproject on a closely related topic (parallel sponsorship), careful attention should be paid to a strict division of budgets - especially when preparing the documentations on the use of funds. In the event of violations of these regulations the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation retains the right to reclaim part or all of the award money. Human and material resources How may or should I employ my staff? The employment of staff should be based on the relevant legal framework regulations governing the receiving institution. All designated forms are possible, including employment contracts on the basis of the TVöD-/TV-L-tariff and fee agreements. In addition to this, the Regulations on the Use of Funds draw specific attention to the fact that fel"

"Breadcrumb Home Funding Call for proposals: 'Evidence for Innovation' Closed Call for Applications Deadline Wednesday, July 28, 2021 - 12:00 Programs Education and Science Duration 12 months (stage 1 grants); 36 months (direct entry grants) Topic(s) Governance Science and Technology Evaluation Economics Countries Central Asia South Asia Far East Asia North of Sahara South of Sahara Funded by IDRC in collaboration with the United Nations Technology Development Bank for Least Developed Countries Budget Stage 1 grants (up to $100,000); direct-entry grants (up to $500,000) Type Grant Status Closed Scope This funding opportunity aims to: generate new evidence on the performance and the distributional impacts of innovation support programs for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), promote collaboration between researchers and innovation agencies, and strengthen networks and capacity for analysis and implementation of innovation policies. Research focus: The funding opportunity supports research that generates evidence on the performance and distributional impacts of SME support programs or policies (e. g. , on women-led enterprises, access to goods and services in underserved communities, employment for youth). There are a wide range of policies and services that seek to create and develop SMEs, referred to here as innovation support programs. The performance of such programs has been examined but there is considerable scope to strengthen the evidence base in lower-income countries. It aims to support an integrative approach to understanding both the firm/economic performance of innovation support programs as well as their social impacts by integrating equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) analyses. The rationale for this focus stems from an interest in promoting evidence-informed decision-making as well as understanding the strengths and weaknesses of targeted EDI initiatives and how economic policies can support social development goals (e. g. , gender equality). Collaboration: The funding opportunity invites active involvement and leadership from both researchers and agency staff responsible for designing and/or implementing innovation support programs. Non-academic collaborators may involve representatives from government and non-profit or for-profit agencies. It is expected that this collaboration will facilitate access to data, improve empirical analysis, and position research evidence for application. Sequenced funding: The application deadline for Stage 1 and direct-entry grants is July 28, 2021. Stage 1 grants will fund survey research and network development over a 12-month period. This preparatory phase will position teams to submit detailed Stage 2 proposals, which would support in-depth analysis of identified innovation support programs.

"Current Funding Opportunities Fiscal Year 2022 Grants Fiscal Year 2022 Request for Proposals Proposal deadline: Wednesday, April 13th 2022 11:59pm EDT Applicant notification: by Friday, July 29th 2022 Funding Opportunities in Fiscal Year 2022 The Marine Mammal Commission will be accepting proposals between November 08, 2021 and April 13, 2022 for projects focused on climate change effects on marine mammals. Funding requests are limited to $50,000 USD. Climate Change Effects on Marine Mammals The Marine Mammal Commission's mission, as defined by the U. S. Marine Mammal Protection Act ((MMPA), is to ensure that global marine mammal populations are restored and maintained as significant functioning elements of healthy marine ecosystems. However, the dynamic nature of ecosystems can make attaining this goal challenging, particularly in the context of understanding and adapting to global climate change. The basic driver of climate change in the global ocean is increasing atmospheric carbon which results in changes such as increased ocean temperatures, ocean acidification, changing currents, loss of sea ice, and increased fresh-water discharge. These changes result in both abiotic (e. g. , sea-level rise) and biotic (e. g. , food web) ecosystem responses. Climate-change may cause marine mammals to alter their distribution, range, phenology, migration routes, or diet, leading to physiological changes in body condition and health as well as influence individuals' exposure to predation, pathogens, toxins, and risks associated with human activities (likely also changing in response to ecosystem alterations). While some climate change effects on marine mammals have been documented, a better understanding of these effects is needed, especially in temperate and tropical regions. Few studies have demonstrated population-level impacts on abundance or vital rates due to climate change. Moreover, mitigation of climate-induced threats to marine mammals is increasingly needed, yet identification of approaches remains challenging. We are seeking proposals for projects that: Further our understanding of how climate change affects, either directly or indirectly, the reproductive performance, survivorship, abundance, or vital rates of marine mammals. OR Advance science-based conservation interventions or management strategies to mitigate climate-change induced threats to marine mammals. Ideally, such approaches should be transferable across species and/or locations. Understanding the effects of climate change requires longitudinal and cross-disciplinary data. Therefore, extra weight will be given to proposals that demonstrate use of, or contribution to, long-term datasets, archives, repositories, or emerging data technologies that are broadly available and accessible for future evaluations of change. Eligibility: Applicants from both within the U. S. as well as outside the U. S. are eligible to apply (including both non-U. S. citizens and those affiliated with non-U. S. institutions). At the time of posting, the federal government is working under a continuing resolution. Availability of funds to support research is dependent on passage of a final budget for the Commission. Proposals will be accepted until Wednesday, April 13, 2022. Proposal Requirements and Submission Information Information on proposal requirements and submission procedures is available on the proposal requirements page. Please review and follow this information carefully. Proposals that are submitted after the deadline or do not meet the requirements will not be evaluated or considered for funding. Proposal Evaluation All proposals will be evaluated with respect to: the importance or significance of the type of project proposed,1 its relevance to the current funding opportunity and focal area and the Commission's mission and goals,2 the technical and resource adequacy of the proposal,3 and the likelihood that the project will achieve its stated objectives or outcomes. Review and selection of applications will be based on a detailed evaluation of these criteria and recommendations for funding. Awards are subject to the availability of funds. Potential applicants may contact Dee Allen, Scientific Program Officer, by e-mail (dallen@mmc. gov) or telephone (301-504-0087) with any questions about proposal requirements, the evaluation process, out-of-cycle funding, or suitability of a topic for Commission funding. During a review cycle, all proposals that meet minimum requirements will be reviewed by the Commission's staff, Committee of Scientific Advisors on Marine Mammals, Commissioners, and external experts, as necessary. The Commission will assign reviewers based on their expertise and assurance that they have no conflict of interest with the proposed activities. The Commission will maintain the confidentiality of all proposals. ___________________________________________________________________________ For example, would such a project significantly contribute to the conservation of a species/population, advance critical scientific understanding, contribute to the development of innovative technology, lead to groundbreaking policy ideas, catalyze critical thinking through a meeting, workshop or symposium, or contribute to an important conservation issue through outreach, communication or education? Mission: ensure consistency with the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and other relevant mandates to protect and conserve marine mammals through oversight of domestic and international policies and actions of federal agencies addressing human impacts to marine mammals and their ecosystems. Strategic Goal: ensure the protection and conservation of marine mammals as functioning elements of healthy, stable marine ecosystems through science-based mitigation and monitoring of anthropogenic impacts on these populations and their ecosystem. For example, are the elements described in the proposal (e. g. , project plan, field and lab procedures, sample sizes, proposed statistical analyses, equipment, research platforms) internally consistent and are they sufficient to achieve the project's goals, objectives, and outcomes?"
"January 22, 2021 The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation's Diagnostic Excellence Initiative recently announced a third funding opportunity soliciting novel ideas and approaches for developing new clinical quality measures to improve diagnosis, specifically targeting three major categories of disease: acute vascular events (such as stroke and myocardial infarction), infections (such as sepsis and pneumonia) and cancer (such as lung and colorectal).

Share this page on Facebook Share this page on Twitter Share this page on LinkedIn The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation's Long Island Sound Futures Fund supports projects to fully restore the health and living resources of Long Island Sound. It operates within a partnership of federal and state agencies, foundations, non-governmental organizations, educational institutions, user groups, and individuals dedicated to restoring and protecting the Sound. Partners Image Image Image Image Image Summary Application Information Program Information Stretching more than 110 miles into the Atlantic, with 600 miles of coastline, the Long Island Sound is an estuary that provides economic and recreational benefits to millions of people while also providing habitat for more than 1,200 invertebrates, 170 species of fish and dozens of species of migratory birds. All 9 million people who live, work, and play in the watershed impacting the Sound can benefit from and help build on the progress that has already been made to restore its health and living resources. The vision for the Sound is of waters that are clean, clear, safe to swim in, and charged with life. It is a vision of waters nourished and protected by extensive coastal wetlands, by publicly accessible, litter-free beaches and preserves, and of undeveloped islands. It is a vision of abundant and diverse wildlife, of flourishing commercial fisheries, of harbors accessible to the boating community, and of a regional consciousness and a way of life that protects and sustains the ecosystem. Funding priorities for this program include: Clean Waters and Healthy Watersheds: Improving water quality by delivering projects that reduce combined sewer overflows, stormwater runoff and nonpoint source nutrient loading into the Long Island Sound. Thriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife: Restoring coastal habitats to maintain resiliency and function, and foster diverse, balanced, and abundant populations of fish, birds and wildlife. Sustainable and Resilient Communities: Increasing knowledge and engagement of the public in the protection and restoration of Long Island Sound. Sound Science and Inclusive Management: Managing Long Island Sound using sound science that is inclusive, adaptive, innovative, and accountable. Since 2005, the Long Island Sound Futures Fund has invested $32 million in 529 projects. The program has generated an additional $49 million in grantee match, for a total conservation impact of $81 million for regional and local projects. The projects have reconnected 115 miles of river for fish passage, restored 805 acres of critical fish and wildlife habitat and open space, treated 201 million gallons of stormwater pollution, and educated and engaged over 4 million people in protection and restoration of the sound. NFWF manages the Long Island Sound Futures Fund in partnership with the Long Island Sound Study through U. S. EPA's Long Island Sound Office. Other partners include U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Long Island Sound Funders Collaborative.

Share this page on Facebook Share this page on Twitter Share this page on LinkedIn The Klamath Basin Restoration Program is a partnership with FWS to support basin-wide restoration projects to protect and benefit native resident and anadromous fish. Located in Southern Oregon and Northern California, the Klamath River is an extremely productive watershed, with extraordinary terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity. Once the third-largest producer of salmon on the West Coast of the United States, over a dozen native fish species are now listed with Special Federal and/or State Status under the Endangered Species Act. Partners Image Image Summary Application Information Program Information Factors contributing to the decline in species include: The development of productive irrigated agriculture in the Klamath Basin has led to land use alterations and a changed hydrologic regime Historical allocation of water for crop irrigation has decreased the amount of water left instream for fish, in turn effecting water quality The construction of roads and dams, and installation of diversion structures have caused channel fragmentation and modification resulting in barriers that impede fish migration Management practices in the headwaters of the basin have contributed to downstream habitat degradation The goal of the Klamath Basin Restoration Program is to address limiting factors facing steelhead, Chinook salmon, coho salmon and Pacific lamprey; support restoration actions to benefit resident fish populations of Lost River and shortnose suckers, bull trout and redband trout; and to undertake activities that will ultimately lead to successful reintroduction of anadromous fish to the upper Klamath Basin.

Share this page on Facebook Share this page on Twitter Share this page on LinkedIn The National Coastal Resilience Fund restores, increases and strengthens natural infrastructure to protect coastal communities while also enhancing habitats for fish and wildlife. Established in 2018, the National Coastal Resilience Fund invests in conservation projects that restore or expand natural features such as coastal marshes and wetlands, dune and beach systems, oyster and coral reefs, forests, coastal rivers and floodplains, and barrier islands that minimize the impacts of storms and other naturally occurring events on nearby communities. Partners Image Image Image Image Image Image Image Summary Application Information Program Information Coastal communities and ecosystems are under threat from rising sea-levels, more intense storms, and changing rainfall patterns. While 40 percent of Americans call the coast home and coastal communities contribute $9. 5 trillion in goods and services annually to the U. S. economy, these areas are increasingly being affected by flooding and other coastal hazards. In 2021, the U. S. experienced 20 extreme weather and climate-related disaster events causing a total of $145 billion in disaster costs, the third-highest year on record. New research shows with sea-level rise and increasing development in coastal areas, the annual cost of flooding in the U. S. will jump by more than 26 percent by 2050, with underserved communities shouldering the greatest burden. At the same time, the U. S. is losing valuable coastal ecosystems that help to buffer communities from these impacts and provide important habitats for fish and wildlife. According to a 2009 study, the U. S. loses 80,000 acres of coastal wetlands each year and these losses are mounting as wetlands and other important coastal habitats continue to be ""squeezed"" by rising sea levels on one side and increasing development on the other. The National Coastal Resilience Fund supports the implementation of nature-based solutions to enhance the resilience of coastal communities and ecosystems to these threats. We strategically invest in projects that construct or restore coastal habitats that increase the capacity of communities and habitats to withstand and recover from disruptions and adapt to changing environmental conditions. Nature-based solutions include natural and hybrid (""green-gray"") solutions, such as restoring coastal marshes, reconnecting floodplains, rebuilding dunes or other natural buffers, and installing living shorelines. Additionally, NFWF prioritizes investments that address the disproportionate risks faced by underserved communities and projects that are community led or incorporate direct community outreach and engagement. A Regional Focus The National Coastal Resilience Fund is a national program with a regional focus. It supports targeted investments that help communities address their specific resilience needs and priorities. The National Coastal Resilience Fund invests in projects that: Benefit coastal communities by reducing threats from coastal hazards (such as rising sea- and lake-levels, more intense storms, increasing flooding and erosion, and melting permafrost) to property and key assets, such as hospitals and evacuation routes; and Benefit fish and wildlife by enhancing the ecological integrity and functionality of coastal ecosystems A Scientific Approach The National Coastal Resilience Fund uses Regional Coastal Resilience Assessments to identify open space areas where nature-based solutions may maximize fish and wildlife benefits and human community resilience to flooding. NFWF also supports socioeconomic assessments, monitoring and evaluation of our on-the-ground restoration projects to evaluate the efficacy of nature-based solutions and improve and refine our approach to building resilience along our coasts.

Share this page on Facebook Share this page on Twitter Share this page on LinkedIn The Bats for the Future Fund provides funding for existing and novel treatments for white-nose syndrome, a disease that has killed over 7 million bats over the past decade. Partners Image Image Image Summary Application Information Program Information Bats play critical roles in the U. S. controlling agricultural, forest, and human pests. Recent studies estimate that the pesticide services of bats are worth more than $1 billion annually to the U. S. corn industry alone, and more than $3 billion annually to all agricultural production. Unfortunately, more than 7 million bats have died over the past decade from the white-nose syndrome disease (WNS) spread. In some sites where WNS has been detected, up to 100 percent of bats have disappeared. Since signs of the disease were first observed in New York in 2006, WNS has spread rapidly to 37 states and 7 Canadian provinces. Most recently, in 2016, it was confirmed in Washington state, confirmed in Texas in 2017 and now suspected to be present in California, Mississippi and New Mexico. WNS is caused by a cold-loving fungus that attacks hibernating bats. More than half of the bat species in the United States and Canada hibernate to survive the winter, and are potentially susceptible to this disease. Without a solution to this devastating problem, several bat species may be in danger of extinction. The Bats for the Future Fund provides grant funding to slow the spread of white-nose syndrome disease (WNS) in North America and promote the survival and recovery of WNS-affected bat populations and species. Objectives are to implement field treatments, management tools and conservation strategies that help WNS-affected bat populations to recover from the impacts of WNS, and support innovative and collaborative research leading to development and deployment of treatments and management tools or strategies for WNS that will perpetuate viable populations of bats. Major funding for the Bats for the Future Fund is provided by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, with additional funding from Southern Company and the Avangrid Foundation.

"Breadcrumb Home / Media Center / Press Releases / . . . Share this page on Facebook Share this page on Twitter Share this page on LinkedIn WASHINGTON, D. C. (April 27, 2022) - The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) today announced a new Coastal Resilience Assessment for Alaska to help identify areas with the greatest potential to improve wildlife habitat and community resilience to flooding threats. The assessment was developed in partnership with NOAA and the University of North Carolina-Asheville's National Environmental Modeling and Analysis Center (NEMAC), with help from a local advisory committee and stakeholders. The Alaska Coastal Resilience Assessment combines information about local flooding threats, human community assets, and fish and wildlife species to identify ""Resilience Hubs"" - areas of open space near communities and critical infrastructure where valuable natural resources and habitats can provide protection to human populations and critical infrastructure facing the greatest risk of flooding from coastal storms, changing sea levels and other threats. Assessment results are intended to complement ongoing coastal resilience planning efforts, and can be used by community planners, conservation organizations, and others to help make informed decisions about the potential for restoration, conservation, or other resilience-related projects to achieve dual benefits for people and wildlife. Results of the Alaska Assessment are available online through the Coastal Resilience Evaluation and Siting Tool (CREST), an easy-to-use, interactive web tool to explore key data layers and results to find potential restoration opportunities. In addition, users can analyze specific project sites to understand potential benefits to fish and wildlife habitat and to community resilience. Completed results, including input datasets, are also available for download. In support of the National Coastal Resilience Fund, NFWF aims to complete Regional Coastal Resilience Assessments for all U. S. coastlines. All assessments are available through NFWF's website here, along with final reports and a detailed methodology. About the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Chartered by Congress in 1984, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) protects and restores the nation's fish, wildlife, plants and habitats. Working with federal, corporate and individual partners, NFWF has funded more than 5,000 organizations and generated a total conservation impact of $6. 8 billion.

This Request for Proposals (RFP) will be used to help NFWF identify qualified consultants that NFWF might engage to provide assistance for the successful evaluation of projects, programs, and activities necessary to implement the NCRF. Among other areas, NFWF requires assistance evaluating the feasibility, regulatory compliance, schedule, costs, and outcomes of proposed projects seeking funding from the NCRF to construct habitat restoration and/or nature-based projects designed to enhance community resilience to coastal hazards and to improve habitat for fish and wildlife. Field work to verify existing conditions and monitor project implementation might also be required. NFWF expects that it will access the type of support contemplated by this RFP through a time and materials contract that will be administered on a ""task order"" basis. BACKGROUND The National Coastal Resilience Fund is a program that NFWF administers in partnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The purpose of the program is to invest in nature-based solutions with the dual goals of increasing the resilience of communities from current and future threats from coastal hazards and improving habitats for fish and wildlife. NFWF administers the NCRF as a national grants program focused on funding projects within the coastal areas of U. S. coastal states, including the Great Lakes states, and U. S. territories and tribal lands. Through the NCRF, NFWF invests in projects advancing nature-based solutions - such as restoring coastal marshes and forests, reconnecting floodplains, rebuilding dunes or other natural buffers, or installing living shorelines. NCRF projects must show clear benefits in terms of reducing current and projected threats to communities from coastal hazards (including sea-level and lake-level changes, flooding, erosion, increased frequency and/or intensity of storms, and impacts from other chronic and episodic factors such as nuisance flooding during high tides, permafrost melt, etc. ) and improvements to habitats for fish and wildlife species. NFWF is also interested in identifying projects that use innovative approaches for addressing coastal hazards and are designed to be sustainable and durable in the face of projected environmental conditions. NFWF funds projects in four categories designed to advance projects through a ""project pipeline,"" including: Community Capacity Building and Planning; Site Assessment and Preliminary Design, Final Design and Permitting, and Restoration Implementation. For more information about the Program, please visit our website at: https://www. nfwf. org/programs/national-coastal-resilience-fund The primary purpose of this RFP is to identify potential contractors with the expertise and experience to assist NFWF in its role as administrator of the NCRF. This role includes the review of project proposals submitted by NCRF applicants with respect to the technical, logistical, and financial merits of the project and expected project outcomes and other results, as appropriate.

Share this page on Facebook Share this page on Twitter Share this page on LinkedIn Related Content PDF Version Tip Sheet Applicant Webinar [Register here]: Wednesday, May 4 at 10:00 AM PST Full Proposal Due Date: Wednesday, May 18 by 8:59 PM PST OVERVIEW The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) is requesting proposals to enhance, restore, and protect stream flows for key fish habitat in the Columbia Basin. The Columbia Basin Water Transaction Program (CBWTP) funds water transactions development and implementation in the United States portion of the Columbia Basin and is the largest voluntary instream flow restoration program in the country. Since its inception in 2002, the CBWTP has implemented over 661 voluntary water transactions and secured over 12. 5 million acre feet of water in flow-limited tributaries of the Columbia River Basin. The CBWTP works across portions of Oregon, Washington, Montana and Idaho, and its investments in water transactions have increased stream flows for the benefit of native fish species, including Pacific salmon, steelhead trout, and resident fish species. Approximately $1. 8 million will be available for programmatic support allowing for staff time, limited travel, supplies/materials, and other associated costs of developing a water transaction(s). NFWF will only accept proposals for programmatic support to develop water transactions under this solicitation, not for water acquisitions. Applicants must show organizational history and competency of implementing water transactions and dedicating water instream in this region. Funding for this program will be primarily provided by Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). A portion of the funding from BPA is dedicated to the areas of the Columbia River basin that are covered by the Columbia Basin Fish Accords with the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation and the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. Proposals in these geographies should be separate from proposals for other geographies. Once an entity is selected through this Request for Proposals (RFP), they will be considered a Qualified Local Entity (QLE) and will be able to apply for funding to pay for individual water transactions during the term of their grant agreement through a competitive process. More information on the water transaction solicitation process can be found here. Qualification status will last three years from the time a full proposal is approved, pending satisfactory annual performance reviews. Existing QLEs will have the option to submit a budget amendment in lieu of a full proposal in the two subsequent years post initial selection. GEOGRAPHIC & SPECIES FOCUS Proposed activities must be located within the Columbia River Basin in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Montana. Priority will be given to areas listed in the 2020 National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Biological Opinion (BiOp) that benefit species listed threatened or endangered by the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA). In collaboration with the Northwest Power and Conservation Council (NPCC) and BPA requirements, NFWF will grant up to 70% of the funding to entities with a focus on anadromous species and 30% of the funding to those projects with a focus on resident fish species. Figure 1. Columbia Basin with BiOp priority geographies Proposed geographies must include tributaries that have identified flow as a priority limiting factor to survival of species in one or more of the below categories: ESA listed species in 2020 BiOp priority areas. ESA listed anadromous species not specified above (National Marine Fisheries Service and 2020 BiOp). ESA listed resident U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service or state species of concern (by one or more of OR, WA, ID, MT). Other fish or wildlife not listed above where a benefit can be tied to increased flows in a specific location. PROGRAM PRIORITIES Competitive programmatic proposals will be sub-basin focused and will address species of concern and flow limitations, while also demonstrating innovation, and incorporating a monitoring plan. 1. Species of concern: Proposals must showcase how the applicant will work toward addressing the conservation needs of one or more species of concern through water transaction implementation. 2. Flow limitations: The proposals must articulate an organizational competency in securing water for in-stream tributary flows at a location(s) where low flows are a limiting factor to fish survival, productivity, and distribution and for the maximum reach of river legally and physically possible. The scale of the recovered instream flows should be measurable relative to the overall flow and the scale of habitat loss and other issues in the basin. Proposals should document the entity's intention of working in areas where significant seniority can be protected in-stream through state agency process or is contractually protectable instream at a time of year when needed to benefit fish and wildlife. 3. Prioritization: Proposals should clearly articulate the prioritization efforts for each subbasin both historic and future. Prioritization efforts should show the hierarchical planning that has gone into the selection of subbasins, streams, and water rights/properties/landowners. The efforts should articulate WHY the subbasin is important compared to other subbasins, WHY a particular stream is important compared to other streams in the subbasin, and WHY those particular transactions are being pursued. Proposals should show this logic path from the subbasin down to the transaction level to emphasize priorities and levels of importance for species. a. Existing plans: If prioritization plans have been completed, describe how those are used in transaction development and planning. b. New plans: If prioritization plans have not been developed, describe how you will utilize the budget to develop them. Prioritization of projects within the CBWTP should be established locally but linked to broader subbasin and recovery plan efforts (NPCC subbasin plan, watershed assessment, or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Recovery Plan). When applying for transactions, the applicant should be able to clearly explain why the particular transaction is important in the system compared to others and what impact it will have for the region. 4. Adaptive management: Demonstrate how your efforts are moving beyond preliminary practices and proof of concept methods. Transactions should strive towards permanent instream flow and work to build on previous efforts. Applicants should use monitoring results to show how experience with local systems has contributed to selection of the most impactful transactions. 5. Innovation: Where possible, proposals should demonstrate how the applicant plans to implement innovative methods to increase tributary flows during critical periods for targeted species. Innovative methods for securing water should also be cost-effective in terms of local and regional markets and build trust with water rights holders. 6. Monitoring: The proposal should document how compliance and implementation monitoring will be carried out and reported via the CBWTP's Flow Restoration Accounting Framework (FRAF) compliance monitoring forms (subject to change from previous years). The proposal should include a description of long-term monitoring of water flow, and how the benefits to habitat and species will be documented. All transactions will be required to have Tier 1 and Tier 2 monitoring unless otherwise approved by CBWTP staff. Based on final award and grant funding decisions, some awardees may also be asked to report additional summary project information through NFWF's web-based Water Calculator tool. NFWF staff will work with those awardees to minimize duplicate data collection and reporting across FRAF and Water Calculator requirements. 7. Watershed context: The proposal should describe collaborative efforts with other entities and document how opportunities for cost-sharing, data sharing and collaboration were considered and developed. 8. Organizational Breadth: Applicants must show that their organization has experience building trust with landowners and implementing water transactions in the identified watersheds. In addition, they must be able to provide and input the requisite water transactions information and metrics into the program database. Finally, they should have the sophistication of providing financial and programmatic reporting required for the program. 9. Community Impact and Engagement: Projects that incorporate outreach to communities, foster community engagement, and pursue collaborative management leading to measurable conservation benefits are encouraged. When possible, projects should be developed through community input and co-design processes ensuring traditional knowledge elevation. Additionally, projects should engage community-level partners (e. g. , municipalities, NGOs, community organizations, community leaders) to help design, implement, and maintain projects to secure maximum benefits for communities, maintenance, and sustainability post-grant award. ELIGIBILITY Eligible and Ineligible Entities Eligible applicants include non-profit 501(c) organizations, U. S. Federal government agencies, state government agencies, local governments, municipal governments, tribal governments and organizations, educational institutions, conservation districts, watershed councils, and other local agencies. Ineligible applicants include businesses, unincorporated individuals, and international organizations. Ineligible Uses of Grant Funds Equipment: Applicants are encouraged to rent equipment where possible and cost-effective or use matching funds to make those purchases. NFWF acknowledges, however, that some projects may only be completed using NFWF funds to procure equipment. If this applies to your project, please contact the program staff listed in this RFP to discuss options. Federal funds and matching contributions may not be used to procure or obtain equipment, services, or systems (including entering into or renewing a contract) that uses telecommunications equipment or services produced by Huawei Technologies Company or ZTE Corporation (or any subsidiary or affiliate of such entities) as a substantial or essential component, or as critical technology of any system. Refer to Public Law 115-232, section 889 for additional information. NFWF funds and matching contributions may not be used to support political advocacy, fundraising, lobbying, litigation, terrorist activities or Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violations. NFWF funds may not be used to support ongoing efforts to comply with legal requirements, including permit conditions, mitigation, and settlement agreements. However, grant funds may be used to support projects that enhance or improve upon existing baseline compliance efforts. FUNDING AVAILABILITY AND MATCH The CBWTP will award approximately $1. 8 million for Qualified Local Entity programmatic grants for the period of October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023. See the below timeline for more details on when to expect an award. Additional Funding Information: Match is not required but encouraged and may include both programmatic and expected transactional contributions anticipated during the grant period. Matching contributions will be considered as part of the evaluation criteria. Funding or in-kind contributions from another NFWF award or other BPA funding is not allowable match. Once an entity is considered qualified and receives a grant through this solicitation, they are then eligible to submit water transaction projects through CBWTP's closed water transaction solicitations. There is a separate review and evaluation process for those proposals. Applicants should budget for staff participation in one CBWTP annual meeting. Meeting will be held within the CBWTP geographic area and typically consist of two to three days of presentations, which discuss successes achieved, lessons learned, innovative concepts and future opportunities. The meeting also provides an opportunity to build capacity through information sharing and networking. Budget should include lodging and travel expenses for each staff person attending. NFWF typically invites up to two participants per organization. COVID travel restrictions may negate this. EVALUATION CRITERIA All proposals will be screened for relevance, accuracy, completeness, and compliance with NFWF and funding source policies. Proposals will then be evaluated based on the extent to which they meet the following criteria. Program Goals and Priorities - Project contributes to the Program's overall habitat and species conservation goals, and has specific, quantifiable performance metrics to evaluate project success. Project addresses one or more of the program priorities. Technical Merit - Project is technically sound and feasible, and the proposal sets forth a clear, logical, and achievable work plan and timeline. Project engages appropriate technical experts throughout project planning, design, and implementation to ensure activities are technically sound and feasible. Partnership and Community Impact - The applicant organization partners and engages collaboratively with diverse local community members, leaders, community-based organizations, and other relevant stakeholders to develop and implement the proposed project.

Please send project proposals to Katherine Morgan, Pacific Northwest Watersheds Manager by May 6, 2022: Katherine. morgan@nfwf. org PROGRAM BACKGROUND The Columbia Basin Water Transactions Program (CBWTP) was developed in 2002 to address chronically diminished stream flows in tributaries of the Columbia River. The native fish species of the Columbia River Basin rely on the healthy flow of rivers and streams for their survival, resilience and persistence. But stretches of many streams and rivers in the Basin run low - and sometimes dry - in summer and early fall because of legal water withdrawals. Inadequate stream flows, often the result of competing out-of-stream water uses like crop irrigation, are a key factor limiting the productivity of Pacific salmon, steelhead trout, and a host of resident fish species. To enhance stream flow, the Columbia Basin Water Transactions Program (CBWTP) works through locally based entities to acquire water rights voluntarily from willing landowners. Using temporary and permanent water rights acquisitions and other incentive-based approaches, the CBWTP supports grantees in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Montana to assist landowners who wish to restore flows to key fish habitat. Voluntary, market-based water transactions provide an effective and fair way to balance out of stream water uses with the need to maintain stream flow for imperiled fish. From 2002 to 2020, the CBWTP has completed over 643 water right transactions, which have restored more than 2. 15 million acre-feet of water to key tributary streams in the Columbia Basin. Funding for this program is provided by the Bonneville Power Administration in cooperation with the Northwest Power and Conservation Council and with support from Altria. CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT By submitting a proposal in response to this solicitation, the offeror warrants and represents that it does not currently have any apparent or actual conflict of interest, as described herein. In the event an offeror currently has, will have during the life of the contemplated contract, or becomes aware of an apparent or actual conflict of interest, in the event an award is made, the offeror must notify NFWF in writing in the Statement of Qualifications, or in subsequent correspondence (if the issue becomes known after the submission of the Statement of Qualifications) of such apparent or actual conflicts of interest, including organizational conflicts of interest. Conflicts of interest include any relationship or matter which might place the contractor, the contractor's employees, or the contractor's subcontractors in a position of conflict, real or apparent, between their responsibilities under the award and any other outside interests, or otherwise. Conflicts of interest may also include, but are not limited to, direct or indirect financial interests, close personal relationships, positions of trust in outside organizations, consideration of future employment arrangements with a different organization, or decision-making affecting the award that would cause a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts to question the impartiality of the offeror, the offeror's employees, or the offeror's future subcontractors in the matter. Upon receipt of such a notice, the NFWF Contracting Officer will determine if a conflict of interest exists and, if so, if there are any possible actions to be taken by the offeror to reduce or resolve the conflict. Failure to resolve conflicts of interest in a manner that satisfies NFWF may result in the proposal not being selected for award. By submitting a proposal in response to this solicitation, the Offeror warrants and represents that it is eligible for award of a Contract resulting from this solicitation and that it is not subject to any of the below circumstances: Has any unpaid Federal tax liability that has been assessed, for which all judicial and administrative remedies have been exhausted or have lapsed, and that is not being paid in a timely manner pursuant to an Contract with the authority responsible for collecting the tax liability, where the awarding agency is aware of the unpaid tax liability, unless the agency has considered suspension or debarment of the corporation and made a determination that this further action is not necessary to protect the interests of the Government; or Was convicted (or had an officer or agent of such corporation acting on behalf of the corporation convicted) of a felony criminal violation under any Federal or State law within the preceding 24 months, where the awarding agency is aware of the conviction, unless the agency has considered suspension or debarment of the corporation and made a determination that this further action is not necessary to protect the interests of the Government; or Is listed on the General Services Administration's, government-wide System for Award Management Exclusions (SAM Exclusions), in accordance with the OMB guidelines at 2 C.

"Grant-making at Oak Foundation Since Oak Foundation was founded in 1983, we have made over 4,650 grants to not-for-profits across the globe. We partner with organisations that work to advance the foundation's overall mission and the strategic goals within programmes. Each programme has its own funding criteria, geographic scope and requirements. The programmes are managed by dedicated staff with deep field expertise and networks. Oak Foundation has an invitation-only application process. The majority of awards are made to our long-standing partners or are invited to apply based on fieldwork and research. Although we operate an invitation-only application process, we want to hear about ideas and work that fit within our programme strategies. Therefore, if an organisation believes that strong alignment exists with Oak Foundation's funding priorities, we encourage the organisation to submit an unsolicited letter of enquiry. We will invite the organisation to apply for a grant if we also find alignment with our funding priorities and if there is available budget. We occasionally develop or join initiatives in our areas of interest by issuing calls for proposals on our website or convening policymakers and practitioners to explore solutions to critical issues. Programme officers will invite an organisation working in our areas of interest to submit a concept note and/or complete an application for funding. Not-for-profit organisations who have not been invited to apply by a programme officer can submit unsolicited requests for funding through our letter of enquiry process. Our process For programme officers to make the best possible recommendation for funding, they strive to gain the most comprehensive view of the organisation, its board members, the project and finances. Therefore, we have a rigorous due diligence and selection process, which includes extensive discussions, financial reviews and site visits. Funding decisions are made by the Board of Trustees, either individually or as a group. While the Board of Trustees meets twice annually, grants are considered on a rolling basis throughout the calendar year. This process does not have a set time frame. It can take from two months to more than a year from the submission of a concept note to final approval, as indicated in the chart on this page. The formal application process begins only when an organisation is invited to submit an application. Timing depends on a number of factors, but we work to ensure the most efficient process possible. After the initial approval of a concept note, organisations are encouraged to reach out to programme officers to learn about the grant-making process and the stages of the application. The lines of communication between the programme officer and the organisations are always open once the organisation has been invited to apply - it is a collaborative effort.

"The first 'Ocean Challenge' was launched on 6 January 2020 and closed on 5 March 2020. The challenge sought innovative solutions to counter the scourge of ocean pollution. Nutrient pollution loads to the oceans have tripled since pre-industrial times, now approaching around 13 million metric tons (mt) per year, leading to exponential growth in eutrophication and the occurrence of hypoxic (low oxygen) areas, now numbering over 500 and causing hundreds of billions of dollars in economic damage annually. Globally, there are only a handful of examples (such as the Danube/Black Sea basin) where nutrient loads have been reduced sufficiently to reverse and eliminate hypoxic areas, hence much work remains to be done on this SDG target. Of the over 300 million metric tons(mt) of plastics produced globally each year, some 4. 8 to 12. 7 million metric tons reach the ocean impacting negatively on marine organisms and ecosystems. Only about 9 percent of the over 2 billion mt of plastic produced to date has been recycled, so we remain a long way from truly 'closing the loop' on ocean plastics pollution. UNEP estimate the annual damage from marine plastics at USD $13 billion per year and growing. Rivers represent a major vector for the introduction of plastics to the ocean, transporting between 9 and 50 percent of the total. SDG 14. 1 calls for ""By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution"". The OIC's first Ocean Challenge focused on SDG14. 1, Ocean pollution, with a strong focus on nutrients and plastics from land-based sources (such as agriculture, wastewater and poorly managed solid waste) while recognizing that ocean-based sources are also important sources for some types of plastics pollution (such as abandoned/lost fishing nets). Meet our first cohort of Ocean Innovators on marine pollution reduction. Read also the news about the Ocean Innovators on the UNDP Newsroom. "
"The second 'Ocean Challenge' was launched on 9 March 2021 and closed on 9 May 2021. Fish represent one of the most important sources of food protein to humanity, supplying 17 percent of total animal protein consumed globally. Since 1967, global per capita fish consumption has more than doubled to 20 kg/yr/person. Nearly 40 million people obtain their jobs and livelihoods from industrial or small-scale fishing. Some 38 percent of fish caught or farmed worldwide are traded internationally. Each year, some 85 million tonnes of wild fish are harvested from the ocean and 30 million tonnes produced through marine aquaculture. According to the UN's Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), 35 percent of fish stocks are considered overfished. Globally, between 11 and 26 million tonnes of annual catch are believed to derive from Illegal, Unregulated or Unreported (IUU) fishing. Harmful fisheries subsidies as high as $20 billion per year promote overfishing and the overcapitalization of fishing fleets. Over the years, the international community has taken important steps to promote sustainable fishing, such as the FAO's Code of Conduct on Responsible Fishing, the 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement, and through the work of various regional fisheries agreements and RFMOs. Nevertheless, progress on key SDG 14 targets pertaining to sustainable fisheries has lagged and the main target, 14. 4, was clearly not met in 2020. Recognizing the increasing urgency of addressing unsustainable fishing, the second OIC Challenge sought innovative solutions that address one or more of the following SDG 14 targets:Project proponents can include governments, private companies (including start-ups), NGO/CSO, United Nations entities, academic institutions, and intergovernmental organizations.

"Access the GoogleTranslated version in French or SpanishThe third OIC Call for Proposals was launched on 10 February 2022 and closes on 09 April 2022, 23:59 CET. From plastics and nutrient pollution to overfishing to climate change, two-thirds of the global ocean is considered to have been negatively impacted by human activities. To recover and benefit from the broad range of ecosystem services the ocean provides to humanity, from food security to nutrient cycling to climate moderation, we need to move to ecosystem-based management of marine ecosystems that are integrated, cross-sectoral, and highly participatory. Area-based management approaches such as Marine Spatial Planning, Integrated Coastal Management, and the Large Marine Ecosystems (LME) approach have all shown promise in achieving these objectives. In its recently completed work, leaders from 14 countries on the High-Level Panel on a Sustainable Blue Economy committed to sustainably manage 100 percent of their national waters by 2025. This High-Level Panel called upon other nations to match their ambition towards having all of the world's ocean Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) under sustainable management by 2030. There is now wide evidence that the establishment and effective management of Marine Protected Areas (MPA) plays a vital role in protecting and restoring marine ecosystems of all types. Studies have demonstrated that properly managed MPAs can increase species diversity, fish size, density and overall biomass. MPAs in certain types of ecosystems, such as seagrass and mangroves, can provide important 'blue carbon' sinks, reduce climate change impacts, and improve ocean health. MPAs help local economies by preserving existing jobs and creating new ones such as ecotourism. And, by promoting sustainable use of harvested marine resources, MPAs can ensure long-term food security and improved economic opportunity for local populations. According to the MPA Atlas, about 6. 1% of ocean area within national jurisdictions (EEZs) and 0. 8 percent of the high seas has implemented fully/highly protected areas. While positive, many scientists agree that overall protection levels as high as 30 percent will be required, underscoring the need for continued progress on Marine Protected Areas. The Blue Economy concept is increasingly recognized as an opportunity for coastal communities and nations to realize enhanced social and economic benefits from the sustainable utilization of their ocean and coastal resources. From Southeast Asia to most of the world's Small Island Developing States (SIDS), the blue economy is often already a significant component of national economic activity. Towards realizing their blue economy ambitions, many countries are now preparing national blue economy assessments/diagnostics, strategies and plans. A key challenge to enhancing a country's blue economy is the identification of new and additional areas of economic activity that are environmentally and socially sustainable and have viable business models that can attract private investment. Building upon the above, the third OIC Challenge seeks innovative solutions that address one or more of the following SDG 14 targets:Please note that eligible activities for this call under SDG 14. 7 should advance blue economy by focusing on new and additional ocean-related activities, outside of sustainable fisheries and aquaculture, which were featured in the 2021 call. Project proponents can include governments, private companies (including start-ups), NGOs/CSOs, United Nations entities, academic institutions, and intergovernmental organizations. While proponents may be based in either developed or developing countries, OIC innovations must directly benefit developing nations, e. g. those that are currently considered UNDP programme countries.

Thousands of chimpanzees are taken from the wild each year to fill the demand for pets, tourist attractions, and bushmeat. PASA's Action for Chimpanzees (AFC) program aims to stop the hunting and confiscation of critically endangered western chimpanzees as well as other primates. PASA is launching a new component of AFC using the latest genome mapping technology to provide data about the illegal chimpanzee trade. PASA member organizations will collect hair samples from chimpanzees residing at their sanctuaries that were confiscated from traffickers throughout West Africa for DNA sequencing. Researchers will use the genome data to precisely determine its location of origin, which is rarely possible with victims of the primate trade. Knowing the origin of each chimpanzee in PASA member wildlife centers will make it possible to return confiscated animals to their country of origin and reintroduce qualified candidates to the wild. Furthermore, this information will be essential for the law enforcement training initiative of our AFC program. Geographic locations of origin of confiscated animals will provide insights about hotspots for chimpanzee poaching, commonly used trafficking routes, and governments that are failing to adequately enforce laws. This will enable projects that disrupt trafficking (including conservation. education, community development, and law enforcement) to focus on the most critical areas. This initiative will save wild chimpanzees at risk of trafficking before they are in danger. Elizabeth Freeman, George Mason University Project Title: ""An integrative approach to understanding musth in Asian elephants (Elephas maximus): conservation from fence to field"" Award Amount: $2,240 Summary: Asian elephants are endangered and increasingly threatened by human-elephant conflict (HEC). HEC is often manifested through crop-raiding, with the most frequent crop-raiders being adult male elephants in musth, a unique male reproductive period in elephants. We still do not understand key factors that drive variations in musth behavior which limits our ability to implement conservation plans that better target males in musth, including crop deterrents and effective land management strategies. Elephants will be studied at three national parks in Sri Lanka and at ten different facilities in the US, including the Oklahoma City Zoo. The goal of this project is to gather behavioral, physiological, and acoustic data about male Asian elephants in musth, with recognition of the influence of intrinsic (age, condition) and extrinsic (social, environmental) factors. Our first objective is to use live observations to generate information about the behavioral correlates of Asian elephant musth, with special attention given to intra- and intersexual interactions, agonistic and affiliative behaviors, foraging, and locomotion. Second, we seek to quantify sexual and metabolic hormone variation among male Asian elephants in and out of musth, and then correlate these values with behaviors and environmental factors. Lastly, we hope to identify unique acoustic components to the musth signal to contribute to efforts to implement acoustic deterrents and early warning systems. These three data streams (behavioral, hormonal, and acoustic) will be integrated with each other to produce a more wholistic and probably more accurate understanding of how musth varies based on the spectrum of internal and external factors that Asian elephants face. We also engage with local stakeholders in Sri Lanka as we collect data, including wildlife officials, park rangers, university students, and farmers. With this new knowledge in hand, we can make meaningful recommendations to wildlife managers and local communities to reduce HEC. Vera Pfannerstill, University of Goettingen Project Title: ""Increasing white rhino translocation success using natural communication methods"" Award Amount: $2,500 Summary: Rhinos are threatened by an ongoing poaching crisis. As a consequence, three of the five remaining rhino species are critically endangered and could be exterminated within our lifetime. To protect them from poaching, rhinos are being translocated from areas of high poaching rates into areas where their protection can be secured. However, translocations sometimes lead to extended movement of released animals out of protected areas into regions where they face high mortality risks. We will examine which individual and transport-related factors, such as age, transport duration and release cohort size, affect movement after translocation and investigate whether rhino movement can be influenced through natural rhino communication signals. We will first analyze the existing database of translocated rhinos in Botswana to identify the factors influencing movement and settlement after release. Secondly, we will record calls of white rhinos to examine the vocal repertoire and to increase the understanding of wild rhino vocal communication. Thirdly, we will perform playback experiments using the recorded calls with wild white rhinos in Botswana. Behavioral responses to playbacks will be analyzed to evaluate the suitability of playbacks as an animal-friendly management tool in translocation projects. The results of the study will contribute to the development of an improved rhino translocation protocol that can be distributed worldwide. Elizabeth Ross, Kasiisi Project Project Title: ""A study of bee health, forage patterns and honey yields, in elephant deterrent beehive fences"" Award Amount: $2,400 Summary: Elephants in Kibale National Park, Uganda are increasingly coming into conflict with people. Beehives strung on wires to form ""fences"" between the forest and neighboring farms deter crop-raiding elephants who, disliking bees, do not cross them, but they have to be large active colonies. In addition, harvested honey generates income for farmers, encouraging participation in beehive fence programs, and also results in better upkeep of other effective elephant deterrents, particularly trenches. Good honey yields are critical for maintaining interest in beehive fence projects, however pilot data from ""fences"" around Kibale Forest show high levels of absconding bee colonies, small, low activity colonies and unpredictable honey harvests. Beehive fences, strung across streams and swamps between trenches, can be a good solution and so finding ways to increase dependable honey yields is crucial. However, this is not easy since despite their critical importance for forest ecosystems and agricultural productivity very little is known about African honeybees. Important data on availability of forage plants, factors impacting bee health and honey yields and how farmers can maintain stable, productive hives is almost absent. In this project, as an adjunct to a larger, already funded initiative setting a baseline for bee health in the KNP ecosystem, we will monitor bee colonies in 2 ""fences"" along forest and swamp boundaries. We will track health by a) measuring a colony's ability to control internal hive temperature and humidity b) scoring brood health c) estimating colony size d) quantifying honey yields and e) determining primary forage plants. Results will be used to improve beekeeping processes making the ""fences"" more effective. Rajan Paudel, Hokkaido University Project Title: ""Breaching the Barrier: Initiating Sloth Bear Conservation Project in the Foothills of Nepal Himalayas"" Award Amount: $360 Summary: This study will look at the genetic diversity of Sloth bear population and how they are adapting to increasing disturbance from humans and changes in availability of food and water resources. The study will take place in southern foot-hills of Nepal, where the Sloth bears are under increasing pressure due to habitat loss, conflicts with local communities and poaching. Using DNA analysis and habitat surveys we will determine the genetic structure and variation in Sloth bear population and determine how human activity and availability of fruits, insects and water resources is altering their habitat utilization. We will also conduct diet analysis to understand what they are eating and see if they are able to adapt with changes in availability of the food resources. We will work together with park rangers and local communities to understand the trends, reasons and mitigation measures for human-sloth conflicts. This information can be used to better monitor existing sloth bear population, manage its habitat and secure local peoples support to conservation efforts. This will help in conservation planning and evidence-based decision making to ensure long-term survival Sloth bear conservation in Nepal. Previous CAN Grant Awardees"

When the call opens, a button appears on the top of this page that will guide you to the application form. Results will be in around June. Our grants do not exceed US$ 20. 000 or € 20. 000. To check your eligibility, please take note of the following main criteria:(1) The PBNF does not support individuals, only registered non-profits. These can be associations, operating foundations, research institutes, local authorities, universities and others. Your non-profit must have an organisational bank account, no personal accounts are allowed. (2) The PBNF aims to help save critically endangered flora and fauna. The urgency of your conservation case is directly related to the priority your project will receive. Therefore, always verify the conservation status of your focus species on the IUCN Red List. As a general rule of thumb, it can be said that you are eligible with a focus species that is at least classified as Vulnerable (VU), and receive a higher priority when the species is classified as Endangered (EN) or Critically Endangered (CR). If the focus species is Near Threatened (NT) or Least Concern (LC) you should not apply, or in case of doubt send an inquiry before applying. (3) Due to the small grant size, the PBNF prefers to support projects in developing countries, with a special focus on the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Pacific/Oceania. If you are from a developed country you may still apply, but you will receive a lower priority and therefore have a lower chance for your project to be acknowledged. (4) The PBNF always wants to see an applied component of the project. If your project is primarily research-based, it is important to highlight how your research engages communities and will lead to impact on the ground. (5) The PBNF focuses on seed funding, supporting organizations in the start-up phase or pilot projects of organizations. The Fund does not favour requests aimed at supporting general ongoing costs of the organization, nor provides co-funding to large projects where the Fund's support represents a small percentage of the overall project budget. (6) The PBNF favours smaller grassroots organisations over bigger international organisations. (7) Other criteria include: Stakeholder involvement and local embedding of the project; An innovative approach; (Economic) sustainability of the project; Local capacity building; Scalability of the project. Having some co-funding secured is appreciated but not a must. (8) The PBNF does not support projects that address too general or global threats such as climate change, deforestation, malnutrition, poverty etc. Also general development programs that for example aim to improve the quality of life in rural villages through economic or agricultural development are not eligible. (9) Only one application per organisation will be taken into consideration for each call for proposals. If an organisation previously received a PBNF grant, a final report must have been submitted to be eligible to newly apply for a PBNF grant. Organizations can be supported for a maximum of three times. You can apply for a PBNF grant simply by clicking the button ""Apply for a PBNF Grant"" on the top of this page.

"Established in 2008 by dog lovers, the Pedigree Foundation supports organizations working to save the lives of dogs that otherwise would be lost. To that end, the foundation invites applications for its 2022 grants program, which will award grants to dog shelters and rescue programs that support dog adoptions. In 2022, the foundation will only be funding grant requests in the following categories: transport programs that support sending or receiving organizations in moving dogs from areas of overpopulation to areas where they're more likely to be adopted; foster programs that move dogs temporarily into loving homes while they await adoption, with foster parents to care and advocate for them; behavior programs that help with socialization, training, and stress relief so dogs can move beyond behaviors that might hinder their adoption into loving, forever families; and matching programs that help increase the likelihood that shelter dogs will bond with their adopters by helping find the best fit for the dogs and potential adopters. Grants will be awarded in the following categories:Dogs Rule Grant: A single grant of up to $100,000 over two years will be awarded in support of an innovative initiative focused on increasing adoptions rates and with a requirement to deliver a manual or toolkit by the end of the program to share with the animal welfare community. Program Development: Grants of up to $15,000 will be awarded in support of program(s) or project(s) dedicated to transporting, fostering, behavior, or matching to increase adoption rates. In addition, applications are open all year for Disaster Relief Grants for natural disasters, puppy mill seizures, or hoarding situations. These are available through a separate application process, which can be accessed here. Applicants must be tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and have a shelter or rescue program that operates in the U. S.

"The LISC Sports & Recreation Department has issued a request for proposals for its NFL Foundation Grassroots Program, which aims to provide nonprofit, neighborhood-based organizations with financial and technical assistance to improve local football fields' quality, safety, and accessibility. The NFL Foundation Grassroots Program provides grants of up to $250,000 for capital improvement projects. There are two levels of funding available: general field support (e. g. , irrigation, bleachers, lights, etc. ); and field surface grants. General Field Support: Applicants may submit requests of up to $50,000 for capital projects not associated with the actual field surface. This support includes the installation/refurbishment of bleachers, concession stands, lights, irrigation systems, etc. Field Surface Grants: Matching grants of up to $250,000 are available to help finance the resurfacing of a community, middle school, or high school football field. Matching grants of up to $250,000 will be available to applicants seeking to install new synthetic sports turf surfaces. A smaller number of matching grants of up to $100,000 will be available to help finance the resurfacing of a community, middle school, or high school football field utilizing natural grass/sod surfaces. If applicants choose to utilize natural grass/sod surfaces as opposed to synthetic sports surfaces, a minimum five-year maintenance plan and corresponding financial budget must be provided in order to demonstrate that the applying organization will maintain the field despite projected wear and tear and potential overuse by youth sports participants. Funds from the program may not be used to maintain field surfaces, as all grant funds must be used for capital expenditures. Strong preference will be given to those proposals that seek to upgrade existing facilities that are in poor condition or otherwise underutilized; demonstrate active use of the fields; attract matching funding that exceeds the minimum required match of 1:1; involve local partnerships with nonprofit community partners (e. g. , USA Football, Parks and Recreation Departments, YMCA branches, etc. ) to promote youth sports safety and community programming on the fields; provide for continuing maintenance and field safety; and involve youth football programs that are currently registered and compliant with USA Football's Football Development Model education program. Projects must be sponsored by nonprofit community-based organizations registered as tax-exempt as defined by section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code or middle or high schools. In addition, all organizations applying for funds must be located specifically and exclusively within NFL target markets and serve low to moderate-income areas within those markets. Proposals are due by May 31, 2022; applicants should email submissions to SportsAndRec@lisc. org. For complete program guidelines and application instructions, see the LISC website. "

"The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has issued a call for proposals for incubating a public health institute in New Jersey. According to RWJF, public health institutes are unique nonprofits that work closely with governmental public health agencies and others to complement health improvement efforts, increase multi-sector collaboration, and leverage new resources to advance population health and well-being. As one of just a few states without a public health institute, New Jersey also has chronically underfunded public health systems-leaving state and local health departments without adequate resources to manage routine matters, including a wide-scale pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic poses a unique opportunity for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to help advance a 21st-century public health system for New Jersey-creating a public health institute (PHI). A PHI is a critical, long-term strategy to improve the state's public health infrastructure, address its wide racial disparities for maternal and infant mortality and racial wealth, and advance racial equity and well-being for all New Jersey's residents. RWJF will make one award of up to $1 million to support an incubating organization to cover the first phase (24 months) of work. The incubating organization will develop and launch a public health institute during that time. The incubating organization will be expected to engage in the following areas of activity: serve as an administrative, operational, and temporary financial home for a public health institute; and support connections to potential partners across the state within diverse sectors. A commitment to equity, diversity, and inclusion, and more specifically, health equity, should be reflected through all aspects of this work, including but not limited to communications about the work and hiring and engagement practices for staff, board members, and contractors. All activities of this project will be supported with technical assistance from the National Network of Public Health Institutes-an active, successful network in 33 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. An optional applicant webinar will be held on April 1, 2022, at 9:00 a. m. ET. Registration is required. Applicants must be either public entities or nonprofit organizations that are tax-exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (and are not private foundations) or nonfunctionally integrated Type III supporting organizations. Applicant organizations must have a physical location and established relationships in New Jersey. For complete program guidelines, application instructions, and to register for the applicant webinar, see the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation website. "

Such relationships benefit the natural world that we depend on and acknowledge the importance of being in harmony with and having a genuine connection to places. First Nations recognizes Native communities' ability to steward their land to ensure sustainable, economic, spiritual, and cultural well-being. In response, First Nations created its Stewarding Native Lands program to provide financial and technical assistance to support Native ecological stewardship and improve Native control of and access to ancestral lands and resources. In the past 20 years, green jobs have been at the forefront of the climate change dialogue as a potential path toward mitigation and economic development. While public attention to this area is relatively recent, making investments toward green jobs in Native communities represents a continuation of both culture and economy. First Nations is accepting applications under its Stewarding Native Lands (SNL) program for Native communities in the early stages of developing and/or expanding programs that support green job development in response to climate change. The organization expects to award 10 grants of up to $100,000 each to eligible organizations. Eligible applicants include but are not limited to: Federal and State Recognized Tribal Governments and Departments; Native-controlled 501(c)(3) nonprofits; Native-controlled community organizations with fiscal sponsorship; and Native §7871 Organizations. Organizations that have not been formalized as nonprofit are encouraged to apply through a fiscal sponsor.

"The Posner Foundation of Pittsburgh has issued a call for proposals for reducing food waste by reshaping consumer environments. The foundation envisions a waste-free food system that prioritizes efficient use of human, financial, and natural resources and invites the opportunity to support promising but perhaps lesser-known or newly emerging solutions that require more funding to realize their potential. According to the foundation, food waste is a system-wide issue and thus requires solutions addressing all aspects of the food system, from production to consumption. Solutions fall into three categories: prevention, rescue, and recycling. Prevention (stopping waste before it happens) offers the most significant environmental and financial impact; however, grant funding has primarily focused on rescue-related solutions in recent years. To that end, the foundation seeks proposals in food waste prevention, explicitly targeted at reshaping consumer environments. By reshaping consumer environments, the foundation believes it can prevent unnecessary household food waste that costs consumers money, wastes resources throughout the food supply chain, and ends up in landfills. Consumers have an important role in reducing waste at the individual level and influencing the industry to adopt practices that minimize waste at scale. Through this call for proposals, the foundation intends to make several awards ranging from between $50,000 and $500,000. Examples of projects include but are not limited to an awareness or education campaign that encourages cultural and behavioral changes to encourage a greater appreciation for and understanding of the food we consume and ultimately less food waste; creative use of social media and messaging strategies to teach fun, engaging approaches to reduce food waste in consumers' own homes; a specific intervention to reshape consumer environments in a targeted food retail, restaurant dining, school, and/or institutional setting; a planning grant to form a strategic partnership amongst organizations to design and roll out a major initiative that may take time to incubate and implement; and partnerships between nonprofit organizations and for-profit actors to explore market-based strategies that bring solutions to broad audiences quickly. Applicants must be tax-exempt as defined by section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code or use a fiscal sponsor. The foundation is not geographically restricted in its grantmaking and is open to funding projects at local, regional, state, national, or international scales. Letters of intent are due April 28, 2022, and selected applicants will be invited to submit a full proposal due May 31, 2022. For complete program guidelines and application instructions, see the Posner Foundation of Pittsburgh website. "

"The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) has issued a request for proposals for its National Coastal Resilience Fund (NCRF), which provides grant funding to restore, increase, and strengthen our nation's ""natural infrastructure,"" including coastal wetlands, reefs, and barrier islands that provide a critical first line of defense for coastal communities and important habitat for fish and wildlife. The NCRF is a public-private partnership between NFWF, NOAA, the U. S. Department of Defense, Occidental, Shell USA, Inc. , and TransRe, with additional support this year from the Bezos Earth Fund. In 2022, the NFWF expects to invest approximately $140 million in grants to support nature-based solutions that will increase protection for communities from coastal storms, sea- and lake-level changes, inundation, and coastal erosion, while also improving valuable coastal ecosystems. NFWF prioritizes projects that are community-led or incorporate direct community engagement and benefit underserved communities facing disproportionate harm from climate impacts. Projects must be located within the coastal areas of the United States' coastal states, including the Great Lakes states and U. S. territories and tribal lands. For this funding opportunity, the eligible project area is defined as all coastal Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) eight watersheds that drain to the sea and any adjacent HUC eight watersheds that are particularly low-lying or tidally influenced (""coastal areas""). A map of NCRFs geographic footprint is also available. All projects under this program must demonstrate a dual benefit to coastal communities and habitats. The NCRF supports projects that will result in the creation and/or restoration of natural systems to increase the resilience of communities from coastal hazards and improve habitats for fish and wildlife species. Proposals must address the following priorities:Nature-Based Solutions: Projects must focus on identifying or implementing natural, nature-based, or hybrid solutions, such as restoring coastal marshes, reconnecting floodplains, rebuilding dunes or other natural buffers, or installing living shorelines to reduce climate risks to communities while enhancing habitats. Community Resilience Benefit: Projects must show clear benefits in terms of reducing current and projected threats to communities from coastal hazards, including, but not limited to sea-level rise, lake-level change, coastal erosion, increased frequency and intensity of storms, and impacts from other chronic or episodic factors (e. g. , nuisance flooding during high tides, permafrost melt). Fish and Wildlife Benefit: Projects must help to improve habitats for fish and wildlife species. Proposals should be as specific as possible in identifying the anticipated benefits to habitats and species resulting from the proposed project. Further priority will be given to projects that demonstrate:Community Impact and Engagement: Projects that benefit underserved communities and directly engage community members in project design and implementation will be prioritized for funding. Projects should engage community-level partners (e. g. , community organizations, community leaders, municipalities, NGOs) to help design, implement, and maintain projects, secure maximum benefits for communities, and ensure sustainability and long-term maintenance post-grant award. Projects that are community-led incorporate outreach to communities, foster community engagement, and pursue collaborative management leading to measurable conservation benefits are encouraged. Innovation, Transferability, and Sustainability: NFWF encourages projects that aim to re-shape thinking on what constitutes coastal community resilience to climate impacts as experienced across different geographies, including approaches that use innovative and sustainable strategies for addressing coastal hazards, in consideration of future climate risks, and transferable approaches that can be scaled for broader impact through integration into other government plans, programs, or policies. To implement these program priorities, NFWF funds activities in four categories designed to advance a project through NFWF's ""project pipeline"" from planning to implementation: 1) community capacity building and planning; 2) site assessment and preliminary design; 3) final design and permitting; 4) restoration implementation. NFWF expects the average awards for projects involving community capacity building and planning, site assessment and preliminary design, and final design and permitting to be in the range of $100,000 to $1 million. For restoration implementation projects, NFWF expects the average awards to be $1 million to $10 million. Eligible applicants include nonprofit 501(c)(3) organizations, state and territorial government agencies, local governments, municipal governments, Tribal governments and organizations, educational institutions, or commercial (for-profit) organizations. Pre-proposals are due April 21, 2022, and selected applicants will be invited to submit a full proposal by June 30, 2022.

"The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation invites applications for its Diagnostic Excellence Initiative, which aims to reduce harm from erroneous or delayed diagnoses, reduce costs and redundancy in the diagnostic process, improve health outcomes, and save lives. According to the foundation, diagnostic errors are the most common cause of medical errors reported by patients, accounting for nearly 60 percent of all errors and an estimated 40,000-80,000 deaths per year. To that end, grants of up to $500,000 over eighteen months will be awarded to support the development of innovative clinical quality measures that promote excellence in the diagnosis of three categories of disease that comprise the most common and most harmful diagnostic errors: acute vascular events (such as stroke and myocardial infarction), infections (such as sepsis and pneumonia), and cancer (such as lung and colorectal cancer). This funding round prioritizes measures intended for use in the MIPS (Merit-based Incentive Payment System) and the MVP (MIPS Value Pathway) and applications that utilize Qualified Clinical Data Registries (QCDRs). However, interested applicants working on other quality measures and data sources are still encouraged to apply. There must be a proposed measure of diagnostic performance based on obtainable evidence in one or more of the three priority categories for this grant opportunity. The expected work requires two interlinked activities: 1) developing the rationale for a measure and 2) operationalizing the measure into an algorithm. Prior work in measure development is beneficial but not required. The foundation is seeking measures that can eventually be developed into fully specified performance indicators that: address a performance improvement opportunity and fill a measurement gap; align with evidence (e. g. , from the medical literature, clinical practice guidelines, or expert consensus); focus on outcomes (although process measures may be considered if they are particularly innovative and link to patient outcomes); are likely to be feasible-that is, the information can be easily and reliably retrieved or designed into commonly available data sources (such as the electronic health records or administrative claims) without imposing excessive burden on clinicians or patients; are likely to be high-value, that is, the challenges associated with developing or implementing the measure are outweighed by the potential benefits once implemented; and rely on a data source (or sources) appropriate for pilot testing and accessible by the grantee for this purpose. The grantee need not be constrained to an existing data source if they have alternative methods or ideas for generating data, although their method must eventually be usable by others. Applicants should have an affiliation with an institution or sponsoring organization, including academic institutions, healthcare delivery systems, medical and clinical specialty societies, patients and patient advocacy groups, medical liability and risk-management organizations, independent research organizations, electronic health record vendors, and others with interest and/or expertise relevant to diagnosis measure development. Applicants must be familiar with the U. S. healthcare system and have grant outputs feasible for implementation in the U. S.

"Ms. Foundation for Women works to build women's collective power in the United States to advance equity and justice for all and works to achieve this mission by investing in and strengthening the capacity of women-led movements to advance meaningful social, cultural, and economic change in the lives of women. To that end, the foundation has released an open call for proposals for its Birth Justice Initiative to support Black, Indigenous, and people of color communities in addressing racial-based health disparities in birth experiences and birth outcomes. According to the foundation, the U. S. has one of all developed countries' highest maternal mortality rates. Black women die at three to four times the rate of white women at birth-one of the widest racial disparities in women's health. Additionally, infant mortality rates show that Black babies die at higher rates than white babies across developing and developed nations. In the U. S. , the infant death rates for all age groups are dropping-though Black infants still die at twice the rate as white infants. The initiative aims to mobilize financial and capacity-building resources for organizations to act using one or more strategies rooted in movement building and organizing, innovation and creativity, and expansion and inclusion. The foundation will fund expansive and inclusive approaches to birth justice that allow it to be as broad as possible and bring it into the intersections while paying close attention to often invisible issues and identities. The foundation aims explicitly to amplify projects centering on Black and Indigenous birthing of people of all genders, disability justice, pregnant and parenting youth, incarceration, infertility, and grief and loss. Through the initiative, grants ranging from $25,000 to $50,000 per year will be awarded for up to two years. The total funding available is $1 million. Applicant organizations must be led by Black, Indigenous, and women of color (at least 50 percent of financial decision makers are Black, Indigenous, and/or women of color), be working to examine and challenge the underlying causes of birth injustice affecting birthing people of color, and who seek to change policies and systems that impact birth outcomes; whose primary mission centers Black, Indigenous and birthing people of color and works to involve the people who are directly affected by birth injustice at various levels of the organization to build leadership within grassroots communities. Applicant organizations must be tax-exempt as defined by section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code or fiscally sponsored by a 501(c)(3) organization and have operating budgets of up to $1. 5 million.

"The Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation invites letters of intent for its Neuroimaging and CSF Biomarker Development Program. According to ADDF, the RFP will support efforts to develop further and validate established biomarkers for which there is a clear clinical need in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. It also prioritizes biomarkers with a defined context of use, a clear advantage over other relevant biomarkers, and a path to commercialization and/or clinical use. Specifically, the RFP focuses on developing novel PET ligands for clinical trials, supporting novel CSF biomarkers, validating established MRI approaches in larger cohorts, and developing novel measures of functional activity such as EEG. Novel biomarkers of neuroinflammation, synaptic integrity, autophagy, and TDP-43 are a high priority. Other target areas of interest include neuronal loss, vascular injury and blood-brain barrier integrity, mitochondria and metabolic function, protein misfolding, oxidative stress, white matter changes, Lewy body dementia, and other novel targets supported by compelling biological rationale and connection to the disease. ADDF has limited interest in CSF measures of amyloid and tau. Grants of up to $600,000 will be awarded in support of the advancement of neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers that can do one or more of the following:Demonstrate Target Engagement for Novel Therapeutics: Biomarkers that can serve as direct measures of target engagement for novel drugs in clinical development. Priority will be given to projects advancing biomarkers that can be used as specific companion biomarkers for therapies currently in the development pipeline; identifying such therapies will strengthen an application. Detect Signs of Disease Earlier and Monitor Progression: Programs aimed at developing sensitive biomarkers that can detect disease earlier than currently available biomarkers. This includes biomarkers that can predict and monitor conversion from cognitively healthy to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or MCI to Alzheimer's disease. ADDF also seeks prognostic markers that can predict rates of cognitive decline. More Accurately Diagnose and Distinguish Between Dementia Subtypes: Many types of dementia can present similar clinical features, and patients often show overlapping pathologies. At present, it is challenging to distinguish between dementia subtypes and proteinopathies. Biomarkers that distinguish between subtypes and stratify patients in clinical trials are a high priority. Eligible applicants include researchers and clinicians at academic medical centers, universities, nonprofits, and biotechnology companies worldwide. Existing companies and new startups are also eligible, and industry partnerships are strongly encouraged. Letters of intent are due May 20, 2022, at 5:00 p. m.

"The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative invites applications for the second round of grants to support plugin projects for the napari image analysis platform. The CZI imaging program seeks to give biologists access to reproducible quantitative image analysis. The rise of Python as a leading platform for scientific computing and machine learning shows promise for biological applications. Yet it remains difficult for biologists to take advantage of the latest developments in deep learning-enabled quantitative analysis because of a lack of visualization and exploratory analysis tools that can support modern microscopy and large imaging datasets. CZI has partnered with napari, a community-built, Python-based, open-source tool for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multidimensional images. Since the launch of the napari hub in June 2021, the napari plugin ecosystem has been growing exponentially, with over 145 plugins available for the research community. As napari's plugin ecosystem grows, it is important for the napari community to find high-quality, trusted plugins-that are well documented and reliable, with intuitive user interfaces and responsive support from their developers-for their data analysis challenges. To support this goal, CZI invites applications for grants of $20,000 in total costs to improve the quality of one or more existing napari plugins through improvements to documentation, user support, usability, reliability, or other activities. This round focuses on ensuring the quality of existing plugins through improvements to documentation, user support, usability, and reliability and establishing foundational plugins for cell biology analyses. Applications for two types of grants will be considered:Quality Improvement: Grants of up to $20,000 (inclusive of up to 15 percent indirect costs) over 12 months will be awarded to improve the quality of one or more existing open-source napari plugins. Priority will be given to plugins with strong potential for increased impact through quality improvements such as documentation, user support, usability, and reliability. Plugins supported by quality improvement grants must be available on the napari hub and source code on a public repository brief the final grant submission date of June 1, 2022. Cell Biology: Grants of up to $20,000 (inclusive of up to 15 percent indirect costs) over 12 months will be awarded to convert existing open-source tools, methods, or processing steps that support common cell biology workflows into one or more napari plugins. Priority will be given to plugins that provide image analysis, processing, and quantification solutions currently lacking in the napari plugin ecosystem through the napari hub. Applications may be submitted by domestic and foreign nonprofit organizations, including public and private institutions, such as colleges, universities, hospitals, laboratories, state and local government, and eligible agencies of the federal government. Software projects operating independently must be affiliated with an organization. For-profit organizations are not eligible. For complete program guidelines and application instructions, see the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative website. "
"The Rapid Response Facility provides funding for conservation emergencies in UNESCO natural World Heritage sites. Applications to the RRF must meet each of our criteria in order to qualify for funding. Please carefully read all the information available below. *Please note, we will not be processing new applications over the Christmas period and will be closed from Monday 20th December 2021 - 4th January 2022. * RRF criteria: 1. The site must be located in an eligible country: RRF grants are restricted to countries that are eligible for 'official development assistance' according to the OECD. A list of countries that are eligible for RRF funding can be found here. Overseas territories of developed countries may occasionally be considered, please contact the Secretariat for advice. 2. The site must be a listed UNESCO natural World Heritage site (or an internationally recognised site of high biodiversity value): RRF grants are available for UNESCO natural World Heritage sites. The list of UNESCO World Heritage sites can be found here; please note UNESCO cultural World Heritage sites are not eligible for RRF funding. In rare cases, we may also consider other high-priority protected areas including; 1) Sites on the tentative World Heritage list We occasionally accept applications from sites on 'tentative' lists, which can be found here. We only consider sites included under natural or mixed categories. 2) Other eligible sites In exceptional circumstances the Rapid Response Facility may provide grants for places other than World Heritage sites. These would need to be one of the following: - a site that directly impacts the 'outstanding universal values' (OUV) of a natural World Heritage site. This includes sites that are in close proximity to a natural World Heritage site, where the threat would impact the biodiversity within the World Heritage site. - sites with other international designations. Such as; UNESCO Man & Biosphere Reserves Ramsar sites Applications for actions outside the World Heritage site network must clearly demonstrate the global significance of the site's biodiversity in order to qualify for funding. 3. Applications must address a sudden emergency situation: The RRF only funds actions at a site facing an 'emergency' threat to its biodiversity. We do not fund on-going issues even if they require urgent action. The RRF's definition of emergency is based on the following criteria, all of which will be considered during the decision process: 1) Suddenness: How recently has the threat emerged or worsened? RRF only consider a situation an emergency if it has arisen in the last few months or weeks, or if the intensity of an existing threat has got suddenly worse. RRF advise applicants to provide evidence of any recent increases in the threat profile where possible. 2) Predictability: Based on past experience, how predictable was the situation? The RRF prioritises funding for situations where the threat was unpredictable and thus difficult to prepare for in advance. 3) Time sensitivity: Will there be a measurable conservation benefit if work starts immediately (within days / 1-2 weeks), rather than in months or years? The RRF prioritises projects that require immediate assistance. 4) Duration and reversibility of impact: Does the threat have the potential to cause long-lasting negative impact to the biodiversity value of the site? The RRF prioritises actions that avert irreversible damage or reduce long-term negative impacts. Applications must meet most or all of these criteria in order to qualify for funding. Those that do not meet the criteria are likely to be rejected by the Secretariat. 4. Applications must be from an eligible organisation: The RRF can make grants to any organisation that has permission to work at the proposed site. The RRF does not make grants to individuals. The types of organisations we fund include (but are not limited to): 1) Government bodies responsible for site management (for example national wildlife agencies, park managers, government ministries etc. ) 2) Registered local, national or international non-governmental organisations (NGOs) 3) Private sector organisations (including local and multinational corporations) Applicant organisations must be able to accept funds into an organisational bank account, directly from the UK in US Dollars (USD). If you are uncertain whether you are eligible to apply or whether your proposal meets the RRF criteria, please contact the Secretariat (rrf@fauna-flora. org) for advice. "

"The Rufford Foundation provides a staged funding process with five different types of grant. In sequence, these are: 1st Rufford Small Grant (up to £6,000). 2nd Rufford Small Grant (up to £6,000). 1st Booster Grant (up to £10,000). 2nd Booster Grant (up to £10,000). Completion Grant (up to £15,000). On receipt of a Completion Grant, applicants cannot apply for further funding. At this stage we expect the project we have funded to be financially stable and supported through larger-scale funders. You can only make one funding application in any 12-month period. If your application is rejected, you will have to wait 12 months before you can make another one. If you receive a grant, you will not be able to make a further application for at least 12 months after the date of payment. General Criteria For all grants there are general criteria. Projects MUST have a nature conservation focus. Applicants should be based in a developing country(those NOT considered by the International Monetary Fund as ""Advanced Economies""). Applicants can be based in a first world country but the project itself MUST be in a developing country. We will NOT consider projects from first world applicants unless the project is in a developing country where there is a clear lack of local conservation capacity. In this case the work would need to have a very significant local capacity building element and be a high conservation priority. We generally fund people who are at the early stages of their conservation careers. Our focus is supporting MSc or PhD students (or equivalent) or those who have graduated from such studies in the past 3 years, though we ONLY consider costs related to the fieldwork element of the study. We also consider applications from others if they fit the General Criteria outlined here. However, we will NOT support undergraduate students studying for a BSc or equivalent. Grants are designed to support small-scale or pilot projects, rather than providing a small amount of funding for a large-scale project. Ideally, we should be providing between 50 and 100% of the costs of the project. For projects where The Rufford Foundation is not the only funder, we will require evidence of support from the other sources. Projects can focus on particular species or have a more general focus such as on a threatened habitat or a major issue like human-wildlife conflict or the need for community education. Our website gives you a good idea of the range of work we fund. We consider work on any species, provided it fulfils the IUCN Red List criteria outlined below. For projects focusing on species, we will NOT consider work on those listed at a global level as Least Concern in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Species listed in all other categories will be considered. We will consider projects on species that do not appear on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species because they have yet to be assessed but are thought to be threatened. There are no restrictions on projects focusing on threatened habitats. General Exclusions The following types of projects will NOT be eligible for support. Pure research with no obvious conservation benefit. Expeditions, particularly where the applicant has to raise funds in order to participate. Attending conferences or seminars.

"The Shark Conservation Fund (SCF) is a collaboration of philanthropists dedicated to solving the global shark and ray crisis. Our goal is to halt the overexploitation of the world's sharks and rays, prevent extinctions and restore imperiled species through strategic and catalytic grantmaking. SCF is a sponsored project of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, Inc. , a registered 501c3 public charity. Our objectives are to: Ensure effective regulation of global trade in shark and ray products through listing the top species of sharks and rays in global trade on CITES Appendices and implementing those listings; Prevent the extinction of the most imperiled sharks and rays by enhancing legal protections in priority countries and at international forums. Combat unsustainable shark and ray fishing globally through the adoption and implementation of conservation and management measures through international forums and in priority countries. The Small Grant Fund supports these objectives by providing grants that do not exceed $25,000 and are one-year in duration. Annually, we have $250,000 available for Small Grants, which typically allows us to make up to 10 grants per year. There is no guarantee that the submission of a Small Grant proposal will lead to funding. Types of projects eligible for Small Grants include: · Emerging conservation opportunities; · Small scientific studies, reports, or evaluations that are directly linked to advance shark and ray conservation policy in the near term; · Scoping larger shark and ray conservation and management projects; and · Capacity building for small NGOs, especially in developing countries. Priority will be given to: Applicants that have not previously received funding from the SCF; Projects that help implement the SCF's investment strategy, especially projects that implement listings of sharks and rays on CITES; Projects that are directly linked to efforts to improve shark and ray conservation policy; and Small NGOs in developing countries. Existing SCF grantees are not eligible to receive a Small Grant, but former SCF grantees are eligible. Only individuals, or groups of individuals, associated with a non-profit organization or an academic institution are eligible to receive funding. Undergraduate and graduate students may receive funding for discrete projects that will lead directly to improved shark and ray conservation and will produce results in one year.

"This annual award, named after the TWAS Fellow Samira Omar, recognizes scientists from Least Developed Countries (LDCs). It carries a cash award of USD4,000 generously provided by Professor Omar. The 2022 award will honour a scientist working in an area relevant to sustainability. Our planet, and therefore our existence, faces several challenges: world population, food security, climate change, biodiversity loss, water scarcity/poor sanitation, energy resources. Sustainability involves considering the relationship between the finite resources of the planet and the way of life adopted by humans: in what way can our existence be maintained and at what level? Sustainability is at the forefront of many discussions at the international scene. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals released by the UN in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda underlie that we must become aware of the fact that we are compromising the future of generations to come. The SDGs may well represent the best attempt at addressing sustainability issues at a global scale. The ""Innovation for Sustainability"" Award will reward scientists for their contribution in an area, albeit multidisciplinary, directly relevant to the science of sustainability. CALL FOR NOMINATIONS: TWAS is inviting nominations for the 2022 Award from all its members as well as science academies, national research councils, universities and scientific institutions in developing and developed countries.

"Under this scheme, grants are awarded to promising high-level research projects in biology, chemistry, mathematics and physics carried out by individual scientists in one of the S&T-lagging countries identified by TWAS. The TWAS Research Grants Programme in Basic Sciences was established in response to the needs of researchers in developing countries, particularly those attached to institutions that lack appropriate research facilities. Under this scheme, grants can be awarded for research projects in biology, chemistry, mathematics and physics either to individual young researchers, or to research units in the science-and-technology-lagging countries (S&TLC) identified by TWAS, to enable them to purchase the research facilities they need to enhance their productivity. The information on this page refers to proposals submitted by individual young researchers. For proposals submitted by research units, please see TWAS Research Grants Programme in Basic Sciences (Groups). The TWAS Research Grants Programme in Basic Sciences aims to: Reinforce and promote scientific research in basic sciences in developing countries; Strengthen developing countries' endogenous capacity in science; Reduce the exodus of scientific talents from the South; Build and sustain units of scientific excellence in S&TLC over a longer period to help them achieve a critical mass of highly qualified and innovative scientists capable of addressing real-life problems facing their countries. The TWAS Research Grants Programme in Basic Sciences complements that of the International Foundation for Science (IFS). The two organizations maintain close contact to ensure the complementarity of the two schemes and to avoid duplication. The TWAS Research Grants Programme supports research in the basic sciences only; proposals focusing on more applied research should therefore be submitted to IFS. TWAS cannot accept projects relating to applications in agriculture or medicine or that use existing techniques to screen, for example, medicinal plants for bioactive substances or to monitor an environment for pollutants; TWAS will have to reject such proposals. The TWAS Research Grants Programme in Basic Sciences is generously supported by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida). The contribution is intended to support research proposals from S&TLCs in dire need of basic research tools. Programme Details TWAS Research Grants are awarded to high-level promising research projects in biology, chemistry, mathematics and physics carried out by individual scientists in the S&T-lagging countries (S&TLC) identified by TWAS.

"World development Sexual and Reproductive Health / Family Planning (SRH) TWF believes that good sexual and reproductive health enables individuals to have more choices and opportunities, and ultimately better life chances. High rates of population growth in low-income countries put great pressure on already stretched resources and services. Population size in Africa is expected to double to 2. 54 billion people by 2050, with concerning implications for national and regional development efforts. Many people lack access to contraception and reproductive health services and this particularly affects women and girls. Having children later and then allowing for optimal birth spacing in between pregnancies enables girls and women to stay longer in education, seek paid employment and reduces the maternal and new-born mortality associated with adolescent pregnancies. Smaller families also mean more support and investment in each child. TWF's current SRH funding strategy: We are prioritising support that fills gaps in regard to improving access to and use of a range of modern contraceptive methods and wider sexual health and reproductive services. In practice, this has resulted in a three-pillar approach to our support, developed via a review of current literature and in discussion with long-time SRH professionals: In-country financing improvement - This largely includes supporting advocacy and accountability for increased funds to be allocated to SRH by district or national governments; improving the commercial sector's role in SRH; or NGOs / CBOs developing non-philanthropic income generation mechanisms (social enterprise) tied to delivering SRH services. Improving the reach of successful, evidence-based SRH initiatives - With this pillar, we are focused on supporting groups to invest in ways to scale their success beyond direct replication of their model. An example of this is the support of complementary partnerships (such as enabling more established groups that have a strong and wide-ranging presence in one or several countries to test and incorporate a new evidence-based model developed by a smaller organisation). A particular focus on scaling models that address a combination of the following will be prioritised: Community-level created SRH demand, mass media or school created SRH demand, improved access to modern contraception, and the development of youth friendly SRH facilities at health centres. In-country capacity building - Potentially, this could include initiatives such as building community-based organisations' systems to support long-term organisational and implementation success; or developing new ways to finance and effectively sustain community health worker and extension services. INFORMATION FOR MAIN GRANT APPLICANTS If you have been funded by TWF through our SRH Main Grant fund within the past five years please email the fund manager directly to discuss potential follow-on funding. For groups new to TWF that are interested in receiving SRH Main Grant funding we are requesting you to provide a submission that differs in format from the general form that is detailed on our World Development, Main Grants page. As such, please follow the guidelines below. In your initial submission we are most interested in understanding your organisation and how it fits in with our SRH priorities, rather than a specific project or initiative that you are pursuing funding for. Thus, please provide the following in no more than one page (one-inch margins, 11-point font - submissions longer than one page will not be accepted): Send the page in the body of an email. Please note that tables and figures don't always display well in this format. At the top of the email provide your name, contact, title, organisation, organisational income vs expenditure, and state that you are applying to the 'TWF World Development Main Grant SRH Fund' - this section does not count against your one-page submission. Indicate the unique added value that your organisation provides to world development in general. Detail how your niche relates to improving use of and access to SRH services. Please include high-level overall organisational impact indicators in this brief description. Detail which of the three above priorities you plan to address (it can be multiple), a high-level summary on how you plan to address these priorities, and if you have engaged in addressing these respective priorities previously (no more than half of your one-page submission should be used for this section). If you haven't engaged in addressing the aforementioned priorities in the past please indicate why you are now looking to incorporate this in future work. Is programmatic sustainability a major focus of your work? If so, what makes it sustainable and how do you know that it is? Who are your three most important international or regional NGO or business collaborators? How many community-based organisations (in-country-based NGOs) do you have a 3+ year relationship with? Please name any of particular strategic importance (no more than three). Review Timeline We aim to undertake a first review of all new submissions within two months of receiving them. The next step will either be a phone call with one our World Development staff members or a notification via email that we will not be considering funding that this time. If your submission is unsuccessful you can resubmit the form in two-years' time. If you are invited for a next step phone call we aim to make a funding decision within six months of the first phone call. Thus, for your planning purposes, please allow for a total of eight months from the time of submission. Organisational Budget Amount: To be eligible for a SRH Main Grant your organisational yearly income should be over £250,000. Grant Duration and Award Amounts: The grants will usually be for a total of up to £100,000 over 2-3 years. Applying from Outside of the UK for a Main Grant You can apply for a SRH grant without having UK charitable status. To do so, you must send us contact details for a named person who is willing to provide us with a reference for your work. This must be someone who satisfies one or more of the following: Works for an international NGO with offices in the UK; or Works for an organisation that the Foundation has previously given a grant to; or Works for an organisation with offices in the UK, which has been a current or former donor to your organisation; or Works for an academic institution, think tank or as an independent consultant who is based in the UK, and which has evaluated your organisation. Ideally, the person you provide as a reference will have visited your organisation and be able to provide feedback on the quality of your work. Please state the name, contact details and your relationship to the referee (i. e. past funder) at the end of your submission. For Main Grant Applicants, the reference information will be considered an annex to your one-page submission, which is detailed below in the Main Grants section. Only applications with references will be considered. INFORMATION FOR SMALL GRANT APPLICANTS For small grant applicants, in this initial application stage we will be reviewing your organisation and a proposed initiative. Your initiative can fit more generally within the goal of improving access to and use of a range of modern contraceptive methods and wider sexual health and reproductive services. Meaning, directly addressing one of the three aforementioned pillars is not required to apply. Stronger proposals will directly address creating or delivering a sustainable model of project delivery. For application procedure, please follow the general instructions detailed on our World Development, Small Grants page. In addition to this information, and within the three pages allowed for your application as detailed on the Small Grants page, please use at least a half-page to detail the following: What is the tangible, overall goal of your organisation in 10 years? Do you consider your long-term strategy to be sustainable? If no, is this something that the organisation has discussed to develop? If yes, what makes it sustainable? What is the biggest challenge you face to developing and implementing your work? The positive impact of your previous work within SRH and/or evidence to support the efficacy of your approach. Organisational Budget Amount: To be eligible for a SRH Small Grant your organisational yearly income should be under £250,000. Grant Duration and Award Amounts: The grants will usually be for a total of up to £10,000 over 2-3 years. Groups based outside of the UK: At present, we do not accept applications to our Small Grants Programme from organisations based outside the UK. We will, however, consider applications by UK-based organisations working in close partnership with local in-country organisations. "
"World development NUTRITION A well-nourished population places fewer burdens on health systems and helps bring about economic growth. But, the world is currently facing a grave nutrition challenge, with an estimated 2 billion people lacking key micronutrients and some 155 million children experiencing stunted growth as a result of poor nutrition. We believe that providing access to a nutritious diet is one of the best ways of transforming people's health, education and livelihoods. Malnutrition early in life can cause irreversible damage to children's growth and development. As such, improving nutrition for mothers and children during the 1000-day window, from a mother's pregnancy to her child's second birthday, is critically important. When children get the right nutrition early in life: there is a greater chance that their bodies and brains will develop typically; they are likely to perform better in school; they will likely to earn more in later life; and they are less likely to develop chronic diseases. To help prevent and tackle global under-nutrition, TWF's current priorities are: Promoting good nutritional practices, with a particular focus on mothers and children during the '1000-day window'; Providing micronutrients for young children and their mothers and de-worming drugs for young children Providing micronutrients through food fortification for all. INFORMATION FOR SMALL GRANT APPLICANTS In addition to demonstrating how your project aligns with TWF's priorities (above), strong applications will demonstrate: Significant direct contribution to the project from the beneficiary community Strong volunteer input from Trustees and supporters The positive impact of your previous work within nutrition and/or evidence to support the efficacy of your intervention Sustainable model of project delivery How the proposed project meets a significant unmet need A diversity of funding sources for your organisation (and/or a sustainable fundraising strategy beyond TWF). INFORMATION FOR MAIN GRANT APPLICANTS Within our Main Grants Programme, we would expect to see organisation demonstrating that they meet our current funding priorities in a highly effective manner with long-term impact.

"World development EDUCATION TWF believes that educating children is key to ensuring a country's long-term development, prosperity and independence. An educated population will help bring about a more vibrant civil society, as well as increase the numbers of people available to offer their skills, knowledge and expertise to support the development of their communities. Education also has a particularly significant impact for women. Evidence suggests that girls who complete primary and secondary education have smaller families, improved health outcomes and earn significantly higher wages. TWF's current priorities in this area are: Improving the quality of secondary, primary and early childhood education Increasing the enrolment and retention of pupils at both primary and secondary level, especially girls and young women. In exceptional circumstances TWF will also consider providing support for other stages of education if applicants can demonstrate that these approaches are particularly effective. INFORMATION FOR SMALL GRANT APPLICANTS In addition to demonstrating how your project aligns with TWF 's priorities (above), strong applications will demonstrate: Significant direct contribution to the project from the beneficiary community Strong volunteer input from Trustees and supporters The positive impact of your previous work within education and/or evidence to support the efficacy of your intervention Sustainable model of project delivery How the proposed project meets a significant unmet need A diversity of funding sources for your organisation (and/or a sustainable fundraising strategy beyond TWF).

"World development WATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENE TWF believes that access to clean drinking water, sanitation and improved hygiene is a core requirement to supporting the sustainable development of a community. Without access to these basic resources people can spend significant time each day collecting water, whilst water-borne diseases will remain prevalent. This can significantly restrict an individual's ability to gain an education or contribute towards household income-generation. This has a particularly damaging impact on women and girls because of their traditional household role in many cultures. TWF believes that safe sanitation and good hygiene is of equal importance to access to a clean water source. The Foundation is keen to support programmes which take an integrated approach to addressing access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene. We recognise that there is a need for improved water, sanitation and hygiene in institutions, as well as in communities. Where projects are working in school environments, they should consider the needs of girls and women, and specifically seek to address menstrual hygiene management as part of any project. In a school setting this should include appropriate latrine facilities for girls and female teachers, as well as increasing students' understanding about menstruation and their access to sanitary products. Examples of organisations which TWF has previously supported under our Water, Sanitation and Hygiene programme can be found here. INFORMATION FOR SMALL GRANT APPLICANTS In addition to demonstrating how your project aligns with TWF's position (above), strong applications will demonstrate: Significant direct contribution to the project from the beneficiary community Strong volunteer input from Trustees and supporters The positive impact of your previous work within WASH and/or evidence to support the efficacy of your intervention Sustainable model of project delivery How the proposed project meets a significant unmet need diversity of funding sources for your organisation (and/or or a sustainable fundraising strategy beyond TWF).

"Environment TROPICAL RAINFORESTS Why we want to help: The world has approximately 4 billion hectares of forest, representing almost 30% of the Earth's landmass, with roughly 56 percent of these forests lying in tropical and subtropical areas. More than 1 billion people rely heavily on forests for their livelihoods, and they are the most biologically-diverse ecosystems on land, home to more than half of all terrestrial species of animals, plants and insects. Forests also play a vital role in global climate regulation through the sequestration and storage of carbon. But despite increased awareness of their importance, forests are experiencing escalating impact from human activities. In recent years we have lost over 3. 5 million hectares of primary forest annually, and yet more forests are becoming degraded or fragmented. It has been calculated that the deforestation of tropical forests is responsible for about 20 percent of current global carbon emissions, making it a major contributor to climate change. What we will support: Under our Tropical Rainforests programme, preference will be given to initiatives working to protect tropical rainforests for their value to the climate, communities and biodiversity, principally through avoided deforestation. We will consider both practical local projects, and strategic initiatives. Local projects Applications for practical local projects that we will consider would typically be working on a specified tropical rainforest area, defined in hectares. We will generally only accept applications for the protection of areas larger than 10,000 hectares. Applicants will need to demonstrate how their project involves: Exposing, addressing and overcoming the local drivers of deforestation Management of the specified area Methods to measure and monitor the protected area Sustainable livelihoods for forest-dependent communities Securing land rights or management rights for forest-dependent communities Click here for examples of local projects we have funded through our Tropical Rainforests programme. Strategic projects We will consider applications for strategic projects that are working on addressing the drivers of deforestation on a wider or international scale. These could include: Working on international or regional forest policy Campaigning for improved practices in commerce Innovative ways of reducing deforestation e. g. financial systems or solutions based on the value of forest ecosystem services Strategic project applicants will have to provide the following information: Evidence of previous successful strategic programmes e. g. an attributable change in policy or improved supply chain. We may ask to see a full copy of the supporting data and evaluation at a later stage; For your proposed programme, the specific measurable outcomes that you expect the programme to achieve, and the methods you will use to monitor these outcomes; The strategy put in place to ensure the sustainability of the programme's objectives for the long term. Click here for examples of strategic projects we have funded through our Tropical Rainforests programme. WHAT WE WILL NOT FUND We are not able to offer funding for: Tree planting projects Projects focused solely on the use of fuel-efficient stoves Projects with animal conservation as the sole focus Research projects Projects focusing on environmental education We are currently not accepting proposals for REDD and carbon finance projects Projects based in countries that are not secure and politically stable. We are therefore unlikely to support projects in conflict-affected areas such as within DRC and CAR. In addition, we only consider proposals from US-based organisations under exceptional circumstances, due to the higher availability of environmental funding in the US compared to the UK.

"Environment MARINE Why we want to help: Oceans cover more than two-thirds of the earth's surface, and the fish that live in their waters are crucial to the world's economy, health and environment. Figures suggest that three billion people, predominantly in low-income countries, depend on fish as their primary source of protein, and over 500 million people depend on fisheries and aquaculture for their livelihoods. Fish stocks are in decline. According to the FAO, the proportion of marine fish stocks estimated to be within biologically sustainable levels decreased from 90% in 1990 to 65. 8% in 2017. Almost 30% of the world's fish stocks are now overfished, and much of this fishing is illegal or unregulated. This overexploitation of the world's oceans threatens not only ocean ecosystems but also endangers the lives and livelihoods of the millions of people dependant on fish. What we will support: Under our Marine programme, preference will be given to initiatives working to halt the decline of fish stocks that communities in developing countries rely on, and those working to bring about sustainable fisheries in Wales. We will consider both practical local projects, and strategic initiatives. The protection of mangroves and seagrasses to benefit local fisheries is also a component of our Marine Programme. Local projects Applications for local projects should demonstrate that they will positively impact upon the marine fisheries they are working to protect, and could include: Development of marine protected areas or sustainable fisheries management Addressing local causes of over-exploitation of fish stocks and other seafood Creation of sustainable livelihoods for coastal and seafood dependent people Securing fishing rights or management rights for fishery-dependent communities Applicants should be able to provide the following: Evidence of previous successful local programmes e. g. , a demonstrable increase in fish stocks; implementation of a management plan; improved livelihoods and/or income levels of fishery-dependent communities. For your proposed project, the specific measurable outcomes that you expect the programme to achieve, and the methods you will use to monitor these outcomes; The strategy put in place to ensure the sustainability of the programme's objectives for the long term. Click here for examples of local projects supported under our Marine programme. Strategic projects We will consider applications for strategic projects that are working on addressing marine issues at a wider or international scale. These could include: Working on international or regional marine policy Campaigning for improved practices in commerce Exploring different fishing practices and techniques Improving information exchange to eradicate illegal unreported and unregulated fishing Applicants should be able to provide the following: Evidence of previous successful strategic programmes e. g. an attributable change in policy or improved supply chain; For your proposed project, the specific measurable outcomes that you expect the programme to achieve, and the methods you will use to monitor these outcomes; The strategy put in place to ensure the sustainability of the programme's objectives for the long term. Click here for examples of strategic projects supported under our Marine programme WHAT WE WILL NOT FUND We are not able to offer funding for: Projects with conservation of non-fish species as the sole focus (e. g. dolphins, turtles or sea birds) Projects focusing on environmental education Projects based in freshwater fisheries (e. g. Lake Victoria) Research projects Projects based in countries that are not secure and politically stable. We are therefore unlikely to support projects in conflict-affected areas In addition, we only consider proposals from US-based organisations under exceptional circumstances, due to the higher availability of environmental funding in the US compared to the UK.

"Child development Within our Child Development Fund, we are interested in the psychological and behavioural development of our children, and particularly in certain neurodevelopmental conditions and the factors that influence them. To that end we fund: Research, as a main priority. Throughout the COVID19 pandemic we have strived to keep our research streams running as close to normal as possible. Nevertheless, you may notice some changes to previous years deadlines. Please bear with us as we navigate these unprecedented times. For 2022/2023 we have calls for research projects that focus on one of five themes relating to child development: Rolandic Epilepsy, ADHD, Motor Impairment, Sleep and or exercise and Diet and/or the microbiome. We are currently inviting applications for research funding into three different topics: Sleep, ADHD, or Exercise (initial applications due 13th February)and look forward to supporting projects that complement our research interests in these areas. As always, we remain particularly interested in research related to neurodevelopmental disorders and their co-occurrence. For more information about the specifics of this call please visit our deadlines page. **Please note there is a change in the application process and format that we are trialling for this call which we hope will make the application processes speedier for all! For more information regarding the new application procedure, please visit our application guidelines page ** We also fund some non-research practical projects, including Dissemination of research (applications accepted all year). and to a lesser extent Practical projects (applications accepted all year). Some examples of organisations which TWF has provided grant support to can be found here. Some useful publications and web links relating to the Child Development fund can be found here. Please note the application procedures for both Dissemination and Practical projects remains unchanged to previous years. "
"Wales ABOUT THE PROGRAMME Although the funding priorities for TWF are the Environment and World Development, the original founders of the Foundation live and work in Wales. To support our local community, we have allocated funding to three important issues: Unpaid Carers Education Enterprise & Employment Unpaid Carers Carers provide a significant contribution to society, the economy and the health and social care sector. However, caring responsibilities can have an adverse impact on the physical and mental health, education and employment potential of those who care, which can result in significantly poorer health and quality of life outcomes. Continuing to struggle without adequate support can have a lasting impact on physical and mental health and the financial wellbeing of carers. The 2011 Census showed that the number of people providing unpaid care for disabled, sick or elderly relatives and loved ones has risen substantially in the last decade. It reveals Wales still has the highest percentage of residents who are providing care compared with any region in England. Furthermore, there is a growing body of evidence that points to the adverse impact on the health, future employment opportunities and social and leisure activities of those providing unpaid care, particularly in young carers. Many young carers, some as young as five years old, remain hidden from sight for a host of reasons, including family loyalty, stigma, bullying and not knowing where to go for support. According to Carers Trust Wales, official figures show there are 7,000 young carers in Wales but new research suggested there could be more than four times that number. The Unpaid Carers funding programme is open to applications from organisations working to support unpaid carers, especially young carers and carers of people with the conditions prioritised in our Child Development research fund. The strongest applications to this fund have been from organisations that: provide a range of carer-centred support services; demonstrate strong links with other projects, interventions, organisations and services to ensure a holistic family support approach; are outcomes-focused, and can measure and evaluate changes to their beneficiaries' circumstances using meaningful monitoring methods; ensure participation of service users in shaping their services; reach a substantial number of individuals; proactively identify and work with the most isolated and vulnerable carers, and offering sufficient and meaningful levels of support. Education The Waterloo Foundation emphatically believes that ""our education today is our economy tomorrow"" and children must be afforded every opportunity to fulfil their potential during their school years. Therefore, applications will be considered under the Education Fund if they address one (or both) of the following priorities: 1 - The attainment gap in Wales The attainment gap between pupils from less well-off homes and their classmates continues to remain a major challenge here in Wales and a key component in the poverty cycle, because of the strong links between poor educational attainment, low pay, unemployment, economic inactivity and social exclusion. Therefore, in order to help reduce the impact that poverty has on the educational attainment of children, The Waterloo Foundation welcomes applications from organisations who aim to address this attainment gap through student, family and community-based interventions 2 - Increasing the Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) skills of young people in Wales The importance of STEM skills to the future prosperity of Wales is well established yet the number of students taking ""traditional"" subjects, particularly in physical sciences and maths, has become worryingly low. Evidence suggests that students are avoiding A level subjects that are perceived to be ""harder"", including STEM, and it is overwhelmingly state school students who are dropping STEM subjects while independent school students are far more likely to take STEM, and gain top grades in these subjects. The challenge of this is to help young people in state education recognise how the STEM subjects that they study can lead to rich and varied career pathways. As such, The Waterloo Foundation supports programmes that aim to inspire young people from diverse backgrounds to pursue further qualifications or careers in STEM subjects. Enterprise & Employment - applications by invitation only. Austerity in the public sector, implications of leaving the European Union and now Covid-19 has widely affected the Welsh economy and the lives of people living and working in Wales. To help address this, the Waterloo Foundation remains committed to supporting organisations that aim to move people closer to permanent, paid employment or self-employment, helping to deliver sustainable and inclusive growth in Wales. However, in order to take a more targeted approach, we will be accepting applications by invitation only and are unable to respond to unsolicited applications. OTHER INFORMATION/ADVICE Although there is no upper or lower limit to our support, awards made under the Unpaid Carers programme typically range from £5,000 - £25,000. Applications from organisations whose primary activity is in the following areas are not eligible: the arts animal welfare heritage general health groups with specific agendas (political, religious)"
